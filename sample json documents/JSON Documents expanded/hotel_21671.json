We are from West Lafayette, IN and though we have visited Las Vegas several times over the past years we have always stayed on the strip. This year we wanted something close to the strip, but not in the middle of the hussle and bussle. The Super 8 was wonderful. The rooms were large, clean, and well maintained. The shower was great and the hot water seemed endless. I will also speak on the friendliness of the staff and front desk people. Great experience and I intend to go out next year 2008 in March for another celebration and stay at the Super 8. Thank you.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Nya Kilback","date":"2013-05-15 22:16:08 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Elenor Deckow PhD","Abagail Waters"],"vacancy":false,"description":"A clean, well run hotel in the side streets near Place Charles de Gaulle.
