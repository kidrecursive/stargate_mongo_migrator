The rooms are basic but clean, comfy and good value for around 55 euro. Breakfast on the terrace was a delight. And the neighborhood was fantastic - a bit of real Istanbul - just off the tourist track but near all the attractions of the old city. And the most amazing burek you will ever taste at a bakery just around the corner! (you must try it!!) Oktay accompanied me there personally and made sure I didn't have any communication problems. Oktay and his family were very polite and catered to all our needs. We booked our airport transfers and bus tickets through him at a good rate which was really convenient and he helped us carry our luggage up to the bus upon our departure. All in all I would recommend to anyone looking for low key, good value.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Alicia Kassulke","date":"2013-11-30 17:25:30 +0300"},{"content":"Mystic Hotel is more of a guest house or hostel than really a hotel. It is overpriced for what it is. We stayed for 2 nights because we booked over internet. Our room had a slight musty odour, was not clean or comfortable (possibly due to the dirty carpets) , and the hotel itself was loud making it difficult to get a sound sleep (you can hear every person walk up the stairs, close doors and run their showers). One the plus side, it is well situated and serves a nice breakfast. However, for about US $15 more, we moved to a different hotel in the same area that was excellent in all respects and was overall a much better value.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":1.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":1.0},"author":"Bernadine Parker","date":"2012-01-24 20:30:18 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Jacynthe Zboncak","Lura Spinka","Catharine Haag","Terrance Denesik","Bryce O'Conner III"],"vacancy":false,"description":"European Style.
