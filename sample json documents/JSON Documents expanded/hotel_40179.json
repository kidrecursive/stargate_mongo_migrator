The Hotel is conveniet, close to airport, food, & shopping. The moment you arrive the property is clean, well lighted, and very clean. The front desk staff greets you & it is obvious that they have reviewed their guest reservations before I checked in. \"Colleen\" is just fantastic at the front. She knew all the info, explained every detail & was Nice. The room, hallways, gym & pool were spotless & made us feel secure from the germ world . The main focal point of this hotel is the lobby, bar, & restaurant area that is a central happy hour meeting place as well as the breakfast venue in the morning. The clientele are mostly business travelers & airline personnel. Given that information the regard from all the staff is that they are greeting you as a professional. Great Coffee, Great Evolution Bed and Plush clean smelling towels. It is really nice to get out of the pool or hot tub & have blue striped towels waiting for you. The bathroom products are Neutrogena & were very well stocked. The fitness room has a clean bathroom & Blue Crystal Water cold water dispenser with cups. The breakfast is run by the real kitchen with a real cook & wait staff. The beginning buffet is simply self serve with real fruit, juice, & the usual breakfast fare. We were impressed with the staff & the nighttime security in the parking lot. For convenience you park right up on the building and all is real close. It helps that the Hilton Homewood suites sister property is adjoining on the west side. We felt safe and relaxed usiung the pool area at night. we will definitely stay here again. Colleen & Brian make this place a service oriented great place to stay. thankyou & enjoy","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":3.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Damaris Hettinger","date":"2014-12-06 07:06:13 +0300"},{"content":"I didn't expect big city hotel staff to be this friendly. Almost all employees smiled and greeted my family. Especially, one employee named Pam went beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable by talking with us and even offered complimentary amenity. She made real positive impression of the hotel and the Miami. Room was spacious and the whole property was clean and fresh. It is right next to another Hilton brand hotel Homewood Suites and whole property is semi gated and has plenty of free parking. Price of hotel breakfast is about twelve dollars but is well worth it. My children enjoyed heated, clean, spacious swimming pool. Location is what you might expect from a near airport hotel and the area reflects that. Which means nowhere scenic or serene. My family really had a good stay.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Dr. Rolando Feeney","date":"2013-09-16 17:43:16 +0300"},{"content":"We just returned from a week's stay at the Wyndham on W. 24th while getting our daughter setup at Parson's. The staff there was incredibly helpful and friendly (especially Aaron and Winnie). It is located between 5th and 6th Avenue and is incredibly convenient to a variety of great shops, stores and restaurants, including a Michelin one-starred place right next door. 24th is not a major cross street but we never had to wait more than 3 minutes for a cab plus you could walk to either 5th or 6th, in about 2 minutes time, if you wanted to catch a bus. We stayed on the 11th floor and did not hear any street noise - other guests, staying on lower floors, said the street noise was annoying - see if you can book a room higher up. Also, check with the front desk folks about getting vouchers for breakfast - the restaurant is a separate thing but they do a good job on omlettes and have a good variety of breakfast choices. We'll stay there again, gladly, when visiting Manhattan.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Yvonne Collins","date":"2012-12-23 21:42:04 +0300"},{"content":"The Wyndham is a very nice hotel with a very good sized shower and bathroom and the room was large by cpmparison to every hotel we have stayed in during prior trips to Chelsea where our son lives. Friendly staff, internet included and very nice location. We've decided this is our favorite and will e the place we will come back to many times. The price is very good as well for the square footage. There is a nice but tight fitness room with two tread mills and an eliptical in between that is open with your key card 24 hours a day.

A few friends and I made a trip to New York recently and stayed at this place for 3 nights. The service was spectacular. The front desk offered helpful advice on places to go and things to eat.
