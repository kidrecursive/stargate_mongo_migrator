The interior design of the lobby is spectacular , with a waterfall and flamingo's. The Heavenly bed is well heavenly and if you wear earplugs the whole time you would have pure heaven. The hotel is dated to say the least as a building and wouldnt be out of place on the high rise strip in benidorm ( no joke) . the patio doors to the balconys are old and have no sound proofing at all. The interior design of the rooms , gives you an immeidate impressions of luxe , but really thats all it is interior design , the walls are paper thin , the bath was more of a shower tray and the sound proffing was none existant. We tried 6 rooms as the first one we went into , wa sover the waterfall whcih was fine , but neighboured the entertaining area , which was very very loud . We had asked for a quiet room by the way. so we were offered another room , complimantary upgrade apparently , whihc we stayed in for the first night due to exhaustion , but his upgradrd room was over the car park whihc is like piccaddilly circus from about 7 in the morning , we then toom a ocena view roomat an extra Â£350 for the 4 nights and its was only quiet whilst the oceann drowned out the sound , you could still hear you neighbours conversation! Maui is superb and well wort a trip my advice get a condo !! as all the other hotels looked the same. If you must viist the westin , just go to the Spa , its was the best massage i have ever had in my life.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Check in / front desk":2.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":1.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":2.0},"author":"Shaniya Wisoky","date":"2012-04-25 12:58:17 +0300"},{"content":"I stayed 5 nights at the Westin on this trip, and 3 at the Hyatt Regency down the beach, and the Westin wins hands down. It's conveniently located adjacent to Whaler's Village, closer to the middle of the Kaanapali Beach walk. Our room was great, it was updated and new, with a plasma flatscreen TV and the Westin signature Heavenly Beds. The Hyatt has an older feel..which might be more Hawaiiana, but for the price I'd take the contemporary luxury of the Westin. Each day at the Westin, housekeeping would provide complementary large bottles of water. It was a great perk not offered at the Hyatt. The grounds and the hotel itself is upscale and beautiful. Great for wedding photos. Lots of waterfalls, and great birdlife (flamingos, swans). My favorite feature of the resort is the pool area. The tiered pool areas are so interstingly designed and landscaped. Just walking through all of the paths is invigorating and kind of exotic. And there are so many trees throughout that you have a lot of shade options when you're out on the pool decks. The pools are so attractive and can satisfy the adventure lover (water slide) and the tranquility seeker (grotto jaccuzzi, adult pool/hydrotherapy spa). They make Kaanapali Beach look blah and boring in comparison. Each morning, my friend and I would race all of the children to be the first on the big pool slide, which is sooo much fun. It's straight out of a water park. And with the 270 degree turn, adults have the advantage for speed and splash. Several restaurants on site. Tropica has a great appetizer menu. I miss the Westin and would love to go back again if a deal comes my way.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Mr. Lura Murray","date":"2015-12-23 03:16:07 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Raymundo Quigley","Alene Schultz","Reymundo Murray"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Our eight peak district cottages are located in a courtyard setting surrounded by a spectacular rural landscape yet only 2 miles from the Peak District Market town of Bakewell","alias":"Peak District Cottages","pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
