The only complaint is that our room had a small shower and the water pressure wasn't very good. I would stay there again. I also think that they have apartment rooms so I'm sure that would be more spacious.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":4.0},"author":"Pedro Skiles","date":"2015-06-15 05:56:39 +0300"},{"content":"The room was clean, but sparse. Not even a chair to sit in. There was a TV, but it was one of those smaller flat-screens that you sometimes see, I guess I really didn't come to the beach to watch TV, though. If we hadn't been allowed to park in the Americana parking lot across the street while it's undergoing renovations, it would have been a nasty inconvenience to have to walk three blocks away across a busy street to get back and forth from the car. The porch was nice, rocking chairs were comfortable, and the breeze felt good. I was dismayed at first about not having a beach view from our room, but that soon faded when I realized what other places in the area were charging. Good thing we were there during the \"off\" season, or it might have seemed a bit cramped.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":3.0,"Rooms":2.0},"author":"Jess Kiehn","date":"2013-01-15 20:07:07 +0300"},{"content":"There are some good things and some bad things about this hotel. First the good: The hotel has a great location. It is located just steps from the boardwalk. It is the second building from the boardwalk which means it doesnt face it but you can see it from the hotels front porches that feature chairs. The managment is on site. The owners ( a husband and wife - although you deal with the wife) live on site. They take up the first floor of the three story hotel so if you need something you can ask them. Then the bad: There are no elevators and so you will have to walk up stairs that are outside with your bags. The rooms and the lobby are on the 2nd and 3rd floors because the owners live on the first floor. Many of the hotels in Ocecan City and even on the boardwalk feature on site parking. This is not one of them. There is a parking lot that is located 3 blocks away (across a very busy road). Another option though is on street parking. There are some spaces in the city that you do not have to pay for and can park for days on end and are very safe which I used my entire stay. I was able to find spaces three times. Since the hotel does not face the boardwalk the side of the hotel has views of the boardwalk. The boardwalk area is very dense so there is another row of buildings between the hotel and the boardwalk so room views arent that great. Overall this hotel was pretty good....it was not that expensive. The hotel is in a great location (there is a hotel across the street and a B&B next to it) so if you can live with the little quirks its worth a try.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":2.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Rory Tillman Jr.","date":"2012-08-01 07:02:02 +0300"},{"content":"The rooms at this hotel are more like separate apartments so it is really good if you want a bit more privacy/independence. Our room (which I think was a medium suite) had a seating area, dining area, kitchen and massive bed. We were in the building on St Stephen's Street and we heard very little noise from the other rooms. The surrounding area was residential and really nice, quiet and felt safe. It was also near to shops (including the Prudential Centre) and two subway stations. Having looked around we found this hotel to be cheaper than a lot of others and, based on the quality of the room and the surrounding area, I think it is good value.","ratings":{"Overall":4.0},"author":"Precious Heaney V","date":"2015-12-21 09:44:05 +0300"},{"content":"Great location and clean rooms. I was in a one bedroom suite with two adults and 3 teenagers. The bed was comfortable, the pull out sofa was *very* uncomfortable. The bedding that was provided for the pullout sofa was inadequate, only a blanket and no bedspread or comforter, my kids froze. I called the next morning for a comforter or extra blankets plus an aerobed and when we got to the room that evening nothing had been placed in the room. Also we were not used to city noise, the windows were not new and thus not soundproofed and we were able to hear people talking in the street.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Vallie Botsford","date":"2015-05-02 02:55:18 +0300"},{"content":"We were shown to an apartment in the cellar of a building that was a block away from The Copley House. The apartment was disgusting to say the least. The room had not been made up, the carpet dirty, fixtures in a poor state of repair and extensive mold on the walls. All though we paid for parking, the spot allocated at the property was already taken and we had to park a block away outside the main building. Much time was wasted attempting to get the apartment made up. Whilst The Copley House is well located; we will not be using it again and do not consider it good value for money.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Miss Ova Heathcote","date":"2014-12-27 17:59:46 +0300"},{"content":"First impressions count. Receptionist was busy eating at her desk when I arrived. Check-in forms strewn over her desk. Check-in was OK, but then was taken to the end of the street and given an address in an adjoining street. This was not a short distance away, but 3 blocks! The room was a bedsit, the furniture old and stained, the bedroom unbelievably small. The wallpaper was peeling and there were holes in them (the walls). There has been no attempt at renovation/updating in about 30 years. For the money this place is a ripoff. The final straw came when I realized I'd left my phone charger behind and called their reception he same day I checked out, but only got their voicemail service. I told them I would return in 2 weeks to collect. hen I called in, guess what? yes the receptionist had his takeout meal half eaten in front of him. No one seemed to have a clue. The senior assistant said they had no procedure for lost property, but then said they usually posted out! This hotel is the pits and you should avoid at all costs. I sure wish I'd taken some photos no one would want to stay, especially at the prices they're charging.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Location":3.0,"Rooms":1.0},"author":"Ms. Lonzo Deckow","date":"2014-07-21 21:34:00 +0300"},{"content":"As most people know who are either going to visit boston or have visited boston already, the hotels there are outrageously expensive. Copley house is actually a great alternative. They offer self-catering apartments in an excellent location. When we first got to the office, which is in a beautiful back bay location on West Newton Street, we were told that they had four different properties and they had upgraded us from a small studio to a medium studio, free of charge, which was at their location on St. Stephens st., a few blocks away. When we got to the place, we found out that we were in a basement studio in a great, little building on a beautiful street, near many of the places that we wanted to go to. Despited being a \"basement\" studio, we really weren't underground and the place actually had it's own private backyard, which was nice, even though we never did use it. The only drawback was the noise. We could hear the water dripping from upstairs constantly, but it wasn't a big deal for us. Some people might get really bothered by these kinds of things, but we realize that when we are travelling, things are bound to happen and for 120 dollars a night, we had absolutely no complaints.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Value":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Raquel Batz","date":"2013-05-31 12:52:11 +0300"},{"content":"We've just come back home (in Montreal, Canada) from a three-night stay at Copley House, in Boston. This place is in a very nice sector of Boston, close to public transportation and all the major hotels and the business area. First of all, you should know that the pictures on the Copley House website are pretty misleading. Actually, theyâ€™re very misleading! We â€“ my wife and two kids â€“ had booked a one-room unit, which is supposed to be the most luxurious one they have. Ouch! If you donâ€™t mind the missing paint on the walls, the moldy smell, the dirty carpets, the so-so beds and sofa beds, and the slimy showers (just to name a few â€œfeaturesâ€�), go ahead and ask for unit 100 in the basement of the 239 West Newton Street building... right next to the laundry room!! That being said, when we saw our unit, we asked to be moved and were given two separate rooms for the first night (11 & 14-year-old kids weren't too happy about sleeping in a different room that their parents, but it was better that being in the basement...), we then had to go back to our smelly basement on the second night, and we were given a nice one-bedroom unit for our third and last night. Thatâ€™s a lot of moving around for such a short trip! We were in Boston with a few other people who stayed in another building (first floor of St. Stephen Street building), and their rooms were fine. I think Iâ€™d go back to the Copley House because of its affordable prices and its tremendous location, but I would ask for specific rooms, i.e. rooms 104 (which has been completely renovated and which is very nice) and room 109 (a one-bedroom unit) in the 239 West Newton Street building. I would also stay away from room 103 (and 100 of course) in this same building. While I wasnâ€™t too impressed with the Copley House, I must say that the staff were all VERY helpful, understanding and accommodating. I really appreciate what they did to make our stay more enjoyable. Finally, they gave me a substantial rebate, which was also greatly appreciated.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5.0,"Check in / front desk":4.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":2.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Adrien Becker","date":"2013-10-02 07:36:37 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Dr. Halle Reynolds","Valerie Orn","Cleveland Labadie"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Caravan Club site, level site for tourers and camper vans.
