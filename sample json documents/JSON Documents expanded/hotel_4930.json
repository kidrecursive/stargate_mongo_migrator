We had to find lodging immediately and read a review that praised this location. We were immediately disappointed with the smoky halls, elevator, and awful smell of air freshener that permeated our room. The room was small and a lot of the amenities were missing--we had no bath mat, no washcloths, kleenex, soap, shampoo. We had no idea that the maid service was only once a week and were disgusted to find that patrons were simply placing their trash bags in the halls. We also did not like the shady characters that were hanging out in the halls and apparently living there long term. The only positive was the location but nothing else. Our price was $140/night but in retrospect we would have been willing to pay much more to stay somewhere else. We would not recommend this place to anyone.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Lilian Grant III","date":"2014-07-21 12:22:33 +0300"},{"content":"Grandchildren had two good days in the water park, but that was enough. Over all they were dissapointed in the waterpark as it quickly became boreing. Need to take along additional friends. Room accomidations were good, beds comfortable, clean, employees friendly. Price was right with their special promotion. Glad we went. I was dissapointed that such a large facility does not recycle. We took our cans and bottles home to recycle. But not much evidence of others doing the same. Not planing on returning.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Perry Bogan","date":"2012-09-24 00:46:46 +0300"},{"content":"We had a lot of issues with this resort. They lost our reservation (I booked with AAA and had a confirmation #). Verify your reservation! They did upgrade our room, but had it been a day later they would not have had room as they were full. As we were trying to check in, a guest was complaining about bugs in his room after being moved from another room with bugs. We did not see any in our room. They also double charged me when we checked out. Again, reservation departments mistake. A lot of wasted time trying to fix these issues. If you do not wait in the long line at least half an hour before the water park opens, you will not get a chair. We went in right at 10:00am the first day and there were no chairs to be had. We ended up sitting on the bar chairs until something cleared up. We asked for more chairs and they said they did not have any. The water park is fun, although the wave pool had very weak waves in it. Fun lazy river, could use better cleaning as there was a lot of debris from the trees in it. The room was spacious. They had the only old school TV's left in the country and ours kept turning itself off. Not to mention they are small. The beds were comfortable, but the pillows were the worst I have slept on. They fold over on themselves. The phone keys looked like they had not been cleaned for a couple years, yuck. Despite all that, the kids did have fun. I don't think we'd go back. We'll try the Hilton next time.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Glenna Carroll","date":"2014-01-28 09:15:24 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Emmitt Dietrich","Clovis Klein","Felicity Stokes","Tristin Boyer","Karlee Ondricka"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Elegant Craftsman-style bed and breakfast with beautiful new rooms with flat screen TVs, free Wi-Fi, private porches.
