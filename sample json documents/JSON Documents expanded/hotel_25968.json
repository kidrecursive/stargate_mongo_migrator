We checked a couple others by looking at the rooms and were very disappointed. As we pulled into this one I really did not get my hopes up, but much to my surprise it was Fantastic. It was an older motel, that was very clean, smelled very clean, and the over all stay was absolutely FANTASTIC. The owners were great, very sweet and honest. I would very much advise others to stay here and the next time I am in Branson, MO this is the first place I will go to get a room. The price was very reasonable and it had all the nice amenities.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Corene Klein","date":"2014-05-06 06:53:11 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Agustin Brekke","Elta Schamberger","Ruthe Pollich","Abbie Kulas","Michael Fay","Norval Baumbach","Flavie Gislason"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Another 4-star hotel with marble baths and free limousine service.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":false,"free_parking":false}
