Pros: convenient central lOcation, very comfortable bed, free wifi are all great aspects for business or leisure traveler to have. There was also a small fridge and microwave in the room. Cons: Saturday night was very noisy-- club on street just below the hotel had noise that was heard even on my upper floor room with windows closed. Other non-weekend nights were better. I would stay again if coming to Toronto","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Omari Medhurst","date":"2014-06-25 18:35:56 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Rhiannon Haag","Violet Graham","Lauriane Gerhold V","Cielo Feest","Sabrina Nolan"],"vacancy":false,"description":"1930's 'Art Deco' motel.
