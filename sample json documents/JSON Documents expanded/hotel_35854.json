We have enjoyed visiting Culebra eight times, staying at Tamarindo Estates the last six times. A special place to which we will surely return. Tamarindo Estates is a modest, well-maintained, gated refuge. The twelve house-keeping units are small but adequate---simple but clean. The kitchens are OK for breakfasts and lunches; we have not tried to cook dinners. The terraces provide spectacular views of sunsets and starry, night-time skies. The management is friendly and responsive to all requests. The Tamarindo Estates private waterfront is broken coral, not sand, and access to the water is difficult (enter at the north end), but once in one finds wonderful snorkeling (turn south, left, along the outer edge of the coral heads). A quarter-mile walk distant is Tamarindo Beach, which provides sand and easy access for less spectacular snorkeling. Difficult to reach Carlos Rosario Beach may offer snorkeling better or equal to that at Tamarindo Estates, but there is no other equal on the island or perhaps elsewhere in the Caribbean. Also on the Tamarindo Estates waterfront is a small, well-maintained, fresh-water swimming pool. A Jeep is essential on Culebra. We have rented from Carlos. Three colmados in town provide adequate grocery selections. Restaurants change from year to year, with Mamacitas, Dinghy Dock, and Barbara Rosaâ€™s perennial and enduring favorites. Flamenco Beach is spectacular. It is crowded on weekends, as is much of the island, which makes one appreciate even more the privacy of Tamarindo Estates. We have stayed on Belize, Bonaire, Saint Vincent, and Puerto Ricoâ€™s big island. Culebra tops all, and Tamarindo Estates is in our opinion the best place to stay on Culebra.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Rodrigo Sauer","date":"2013-04-11 10:29:59 +0300"},{"content":"Tamarindo Estates is a beautiful property with very cute villas. The villas were extremely clean and well-equipped with everything we needed to be comfortable. From the porch you have amazing views of the ocean and surrounding islands. The private beaches at Tamarindo were easy to get to and very clean. Jose and Luis were very friendly and helpful.
