We booked it after looking at all the past reviews. Excellent well maintained property. Comfortable & spacious room. Superb breakfast. Location: Not in the heart of the city. but well connected with 2 min walk from bus stop (you can buy bus tickets at hotel reception). Service & Staff: very friendly and attentive. At under 50euro a night including breakfast & Wifi, its a great value for money too. Only thing that can be improved is to have directions, sign boards on the main road and at the hotel. After getting down at bus stop, we found it little difficult to locate the hotel. Hotel name display at the hotel is very small and easy to miss.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Lewis Runte","date":"2013-03-29 04:53:12 +0300"},{"content":"Location is good for city trips and to relax after.
