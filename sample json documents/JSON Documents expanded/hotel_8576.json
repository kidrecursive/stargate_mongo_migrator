Located in an area not very easy to get if you are driving yourself. I would advise taking a taxi to get there. The service from the first \"hello\" until the last \"bye\" was impecable. The terrace restaurant wiew is second to none. The food was excellent. The staff was very nice. In short, next time I am going to Isnbul, I dont believe I will stay anywehere else.

But it is in a great location in a street with no passing traffic. Its so quiet. Access to the main sites is easy. Downhill, the tram is within a 5 minute walk and uphill, Iskatel Cadesi ( a buzzing main street with loads of shops and restaurants) and a 2 minute walk round the corner leads to some narrow streets full of atmosphere and restaurants This boutique hotel itself is a sea of tranquility with beautifully appointed rooms, a great breakfast and very helpful staff. Our only regret was that the Terrace bar wasn't open but as the weather was unseasonably inclement it wasn't a problem. We had a great time and would definitely recommend the TomTom Suites","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Bulah Weissnat","date":"2013-06-01 17:06:53 +0300"},{"content":"Staying at Tomtom was the best possible choice we could have made, everything was simply perfect: the location, the facilities, the staff, the quality of the food, the elegance and modern style of the furniture, the superb view of the terrace where we had breakfast as well as a wonderful dinner and a lovely evening. Many details made us feel at home, such as the Ipod dock in the rooms and the Ipads we could use free of charge during breakfast. Most of all, the friendliness of the staff, all of them extremely helpful. I'd highlight Chiara, who gave us many tips, especially telling us to go to Bagdah st., on the Asian side, a place great place that no books mentioned; and Ali, a wonderful guy, much more than a concierge, and a perfect host who did everything he could to make our stay as good as it gets. the proximity to Istklal street, and the tram make the location convenient for both day and night. Considering everything, including the fair rates cherged, I doubt there's a better choice in town.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Ottis Pacocha","date":"2012-08-07 08:16:49 +0300"},{"content":"A really wonderful hotel in a superb location on a traffic free road. It was so peaceful it was easy to forget that we were in the middle of one of the world's busiest cities. The staff were deligthful and couldn't do enough to help. The hotel is in a converted monastary which has been sympathetically refurbished, the artwork depicting istanbul brings a touch of colour - especially in the lift shaft. Our room was enormous and well appointed with a luxurious large bathroom - and yes, a jacuzzi bath. The rooftop restaurant and bar was a perfect way to relax at the end of the day and must have some of the best views in Istanbul over the Bosphorous and the Golden Horn. The food was excellent, modern turkish using french cooking techniques and local produce. Overall I can't wait to go back and I can't recommend the place highly enough.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Dr. Amira Murazik","date":"2013-10-14 03:30:16 +0300"},{"content":"My wife, mother and I really enjoyed our recent stay at TomTom. We always prefer smaller boutique places that are well designed and in actual neighborhoods vs. larger impersonal luxury hotels. TomTom didn't dissapoint! As previously mentioned, beautifully designed and furnished rooms, the best toiletries, etc. The roof deck is very nice with a great view. The location is amazing, in-between everywhere that you want to go but far enough away from the touristy madness. I'd argue it's one of the best situated hotels in Istanbul. As mentioned, it's a very steep but quick walk up to the main street of Isklal. However, this can be challenging if you have any mobility issues. In general, the area is rather hilly but so is most of Istanbul. In the other direction, you can walk up into a neighborhood renowned for antiques and nice cafes or down to the tram that takes you to the main tourist attractions or the road to get to Ortokoy or Bebek. At no point does it feel like you are in the \"tourist district\" but you never feel unwelcome or out of place. As for noise, we found the building itself to be quiet and well insulated. You didn't hear noise from the rooms around you and minimal noise from the room above. Nowhere near as bad as what an earlier reviewer described. The only real noise to speak of does come from the kids in the morning and the afternoon who walk on the dead-end road to and from school. Other than this, and some kids playing soccer on occasion, the street outside of the hotel is pretty quiet Breakfast in the morning is great. Freshly baked pastries (done at the hotel) and fruit, cheeses and meats, served by extremely friendly staff. Fuat in particular is a delight to interact with and was extremely helpful. The staff overall is very friendly and accommodating. Everyone at the front desk regardless of time of day did whatever they could to make sure we were receiving the best service possible. There are however a few things that need improvement to make the hotel even better. -While breakfast is excellent, we were less than impressed with dinner. To the point that we ate there once and did not choose to repeat the experience. The service was good but the quality of the food and the cooking was pretty bad esp. considering the prices of the food vs. what can be had in the neighborhood for much less. We are admitted foodies, but we didn't hold the hotel restaurant up to lofty expectations. This needs to be addressed. -While the staff is very friendly and eager to help, the hotel would benefit from a dedicated concierge or someone who really knows about the various restaurants around the city. With a hotel of this caliber, we expected them to be more informed about different places and to let us know how traffic can affect getting there, etc. If you didn't ask them these kinds of questions, it didn't occur to them to tell you. -Lastly, with the windows closed in the room there is zero airflow without having the heat on and it's extremely dry. I understand them not wanting to run the AC unless the temperature warrants, but there should be a way to circulate air without opening the windows in the spring (see my earlier comment about noise from school kids in the morning). In conclusion, we wouldn't hesitate to recommend TomTom to friends and hope to stay there again the next time we are in Istanbul.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Marcelle Haley","date":"2015-07-17 19:17:23 +0300"},{"content":"We had been at Istanbul for business purposes and used to stay at the well-known brands at Taxim. This time the trip was for leisure and we were looking for a charming, cozy, friendly, clean, staff friendly boutique hotel. So, THIS IS TomTom suites and we consider ourselves very lucky to stay there. Due to the Italian embassy its socak is not crowded and safe 24/7. Breakfast variety was very satisfactory, view from terrace wonderful, staff very friendly, very quiet and clean. If you are looking for a hotel with ID, we strongly recommend it.
