I've stayed at downtown hotels (Union Square) for business, spending hundreds each night. The rate here was totally reasonable, and location can't be beat. The desk folks let us check in at 10:30 a.m. (due to an early flight from the East Coast) and were very friendly and accommodating. The room was on the small side but perfectly adequate. Though it's an historic hotel, all bathroom fixtures were modern. The bar was very welcoming, with a great bartender. All staff were helpful in helping us figure out how to negotiate the city via public transportation. The only downside was paying $29 a day for parking, but tha't par for S.F. Wish the hotel had been able to negotiate a discount. All in all, a terrific, affordable, friendly place to stay!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Sandy O'Connell","date":"2014-04-30 05:36:35 +0300"},{"content":"My only criticism was that because we booked through Priceline, we were given twin beds.
