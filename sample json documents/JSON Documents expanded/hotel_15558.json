I read the many \"mixed\" reviews about this hotel and others before making our reservation. There were positive and negative reviews for almost all the hotels we considered. Based on the negative reviews of some of the older rooms at the Hilton, I called the hotel directly and reserved a renovated room in the Tower. We were thrilled with the room....ocean and lagoon view, fabulous walk-in glass enclosed shower, king size bed). Our package included the daily breakfast buffet (fantastic), plus free access to their nice fitness center. We rented a car and thought the location was great (it's the closest resort style hotel to Old San Juan) and also has easy access to Condado. The Hilton has beautiful grounds, a wonderful resort type pool and private beach....but don't go to San Juan expecting fabulous Caribbean beaches...you would need to go to resorts in other parts of Puerto Rico for those beaches. The meals at the hotel were good but pricey. We had dinner twice at Aqua Viva, a seafood restaurant in Old San Juan, and loved it! We also found the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful. The original part of the Caribe Hilton was built around 1950 and has a nice history...one of the first major resorts in the Caribbean....and hosted stars like Frank Sinatra....they also invented the Pina Colada here. Although extensively renovated over the years...from some of the other reviews...it sounds like some of the older physical infrastruture is showing its age. Evidently Hilton originally leased the land under the hotel from Puerto Rico....and finalized an agreement a few years ago to actually purchase the land. They are building new condo's on the hotel grounds which will be part of the Hilton. Next to that....as you look toward downtown...will be an upscale urban mall/shopping area, a casino....and eventually a \"river walk\" along the lagoon leading downtown and to the new Convention Center. We loved our stay at the Hilton and would definitely go back. A friend of ours always stays at the Ritz Carlton (near the airport) which seems (by the reveiws) to be the nicest hotel in San Juan. However, we wanted to be closer in town.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":4.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Ms. Tianna Parisian","date":"2013-06-18 17:40:12 +0300"},{"content":"My boyfriend and I (both 26) stayed at this hotel for one night on July 31 before a cruise. When we booked the hotel in April we were worried because of reviews we saw here but we opted to stay here anyway and we were very happy we did. We arrived around 5pm and our room was not ready yet but we were able to check our bags and explore the grounds a bit and were given free drink coupons so we were not too bothered by our delay getting into our room. When the room was ready I was pleasently surprised that our particular room looked exactly like the pictures on the website and I honestly could not find one thing to complain about. The room and bathroom were clean, the AC worked great, the bed was very comfy, and we experienced no bad odors at all. We went to Old San Juan for dinner which was great but I cannot really comment on the quality/price of food at the hotel itself (I would highly recommend Buru though for great tapas in old san juan) The grounds were perfect. We quite enjoyed laying on a hammock on the beach late at night listening to the ocean while drinking mojitos! On Saturday we got up early and grabed coffee and a bite to eat at Starbucks which was in the lobby and then spent the morning on the beach which again was clean and perfect for getting some sun and having fun in the ocean. There are a few convienience type stores around the hotel as well as a Subway about a 3 minute walk away (a safe walk as well) Overall we were very impressed with this hotel and would have no problem recommending it to others to stay at before/after a cruise. However, I probably would not recommed it to business travelers who may not be taking in the outdoor ammenites that this hotel has to offer. The hotel did not really seem to have it's act together in terms of check-in but it didn't really bother us too much as we were on vacation and were not about to let a delay in getting to our room get us down. Also, families may want to beware because of the lack of affordable food near by.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":3.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Richmond Eichmann","date":"2015-11-15 05:05:17 +0300"},{"content":"I stayed at the Carbie Hilton May23-26 2005. I found it to be very nice but far from everything. Taking cabs everywhere gets expensive so you are stuck eating all your meals in the hotel. Breakfast at the Palmeras was terrible and when I complained they didn't even offer a discount or take anything off the bill. Your better off getting a muffin at the Starbucks located in the lobby of the hotel and saving yourself $40.00 the Palmeras charges for breakfast! The room in the new tower was great (King Deluxe Plus) beautiful bathroom, great view from room 1767! The staff was helpful and quick to fix the clogged toilet in our room. I went to the Wyndam Condado Plaza for dinner and gambling one night and next time would probably stay there because it's in the middle of everything! Overall we had a good time but watch out for the prices and the pool bar, two frozen Mudslides were $19.00!!","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Service":3.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Miss Ursula Reilly","date":"2013-11-24 01:02:15 +0300"},{"content":"I now understand the mixed reviews for at the Caribe Hilton. We stayed there pre-cruise and post-cruise recently - and what a difference 7 days made! The first night was \"fair\" - room was not ready well after check-in time but we were compensated with a drink on the house for our inconvenience. The bar service was very slow and what surprised me the most was that the servers at the bar were not allowed to handle cash and make change -- they had to take money to a cashier station to log their transaction before providing change - this made the process very tedious and slow -- this also designates that they have a trust issue with the bar staff - not good. The room was adequate - in the renovated tower, with sliding glass door and balcony with ocean view. Bed was very comfortable but leaking toilet kept us awake much of the night. Noticed peeling paint that was in need of repair. The service in the Palmeras restaurant that night was very good. Had an excellent cruise on Celebrity Constellation - topnotch service, all the way! What a downer to return to the Caribe Hilton post-cruise and experience an entirely different experience. The room was not ready (again) and this time no drink coupons (consistency?). We were in the \"old\" tower this time. The view was spectacular once again, however, what's with the old wooden rotted door from the 1950's leading our to the balcony? - and the rust stains on the carpet? - and more peeling paint? - (at least the toilet didn't leak this time) - but the bath was missing soap dish and more peeling paint in the bath area. In the hallway, there are housekeepers sitting on the floor. Dinner again at the Palmeras, but this time the service was awful. Server was rude and unattentive, but manager ended up comping our meal when we brought it to her attention. But the worst was yet to come: Upon returning to the room after an evening out in Old San Juan, went out on the balcony for a nightcap and a last look at the beautiful view. The old rotted wooden door closes behind us and LOCKS! - We are locked out on the 8th floor balcony at 4:00 am! - very scary, no one around, no security down below. We end up having to remove the old rotted panel at the bottom of the door to let ourselves back in. We call resident manager and ask to be moved to another room. They said they would patch up the door for the night instead. But after we explained all the other issues with our stay, we were moved to another room (in the \"new\" tower). I'll never forget the stay at Caribe Hilton and would never stay there again. (We paid $280/night for this) -- True, the view is beautiful and the landscaping was impressive - but isn't it what's inside that counts sometimes? and the staff? and the management? - that's what's lacking at Caribe Hilton.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Service":1.0,"Rooms":1.0},"author":"Eleonore Rice III","date":"2012-06-28 22:34:47 +0300"},{"content":"Stayed at the Caribe Hilton for a week from 1/31/05 to 2/4/05 and found it to be a good hotel but VERY overpriced. Then again overpriced is the theme in San Juan Puerto Rico. They just spent $60 million renovating the hotel but some sections of the hotel are still not quite up to date. The hotel has a nice beach and pool area but is not within walking distance of anything. Thats where the overpriced taxis come into play. If you must go to Puerto Rico, then this is a good choice among the hotels in San Juan (if you can get past the $18.50 breakfat buffet and $7 bottle of water from the mini bar). If you have an option go to the Dominican Republic or Mexico and spend 1/2 of the money on eveything.","ratings":{"Overall":3.0},"author":"Johnnie Crooks","date":"2012-03-06 09:40:22 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Freida Larkin","Maverick Schumm","Herminia Rutherford","Marilyne Gottlieb"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Modern hostel affiliated to the SYHA, run by a local group.
