What a beautiful hotel!!! I thought I was in a different era! The chandeliers were absolutely gorgeous. The hotel itself was so elegant and very clean. Although our room and bathroom was small, but that part of the charm. After all it was built with the European flair. Check out the third floor where Merilyn Monroe suite is located. Can you imagine?? I don't know what the other people expect, but I thought it was just beautiful. I wish I could have been there when all the movies stars stayed there.

We arrived at 5:00 PM on Saturday. There was no valet. Parking was two blocks away. No bellman to help with the bags. Small rooms were expected, but light emitting vents over the door was not. The place was noisy, as there were no double paned windows and the vents in the bathroom were like a megaphone to others rooms! Shower was clogged, it took 20 minutes for the drain to go down. Worst of all was the lack of advertised wireless internet. The connection kept dropping after one or two minutes making any kind of web work impossible! Staff gave an explanation which was not believable by anyone with even the basics of networking, let alone an IP professional. If they don't know, then say so...don't give me a story. Did I mention that there was no food service on Sunday morning? The clerk cheerfully directed guests to a diner four blocks away, which was closed! Bottom line: We will not stay here again.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":1.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Darrion Gibson","date":"2015-02-26 21:22:08 +0300"},{"content":"They did not give the price quoted once we arrivered in Phoenix, the security was awesome, but the front desk clerks were rude.","ratings":{"Overall":1.0},"author":"Foster Fahey","date":"2013-07-05 03:14:02 +0300"},{"content":"We booked and paid in advance through Expedia. On arrival at 9pm, we were informed that they were overbooked and had no available rooms. There was a second customer being told the same. We were given a room at the Ramada, which is clearly lower cost and standard. No refund offered or given. Reception staff were very aloof and very slow.","ratings":{"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Service":1.0},"author":"Letitia Lind","date":"2012-02-03 13:48:43 +0300"},{"content":"This is another place that I think other reviewers and I went to two different places. I would definitely stay here again. Pros - Room was very clean and comfortable. It is an extended stay, so you get the couch, kitchen, and such. Bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels to choose from. Very quiet all night and when you travel in the immediate area, you have some good choices for a meal. Front desk people were generally friendly. Cons - Wifi didn't exist or you had to pay, never quite figured it out. Hallway had a funny smell. Location is a bit off I-10, but it wasn't too far and minimal traffic made it easy to get to it and back to I-10.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Amie Stamm","date":"2014-04-15 04:40:04 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Jarod Nikolaus"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Historic bed and breakfast.
