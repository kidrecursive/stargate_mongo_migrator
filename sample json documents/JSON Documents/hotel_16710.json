The casitas are funky but comfortable--and most importantly they are air conditioned. Down by the water there's also a restaurant in season (not open in the summer) and a swimming pool. You'll take a long, rutted road to get to Tamarindo, but by then you'll be used to potholes and ditches since all the roads on Culebra could use a good coat of asphalt. Recommended for families, friends or couples.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Maria Tillman IV","date":"2015-06-04 03:20:13 +0300"},{"content":"The Tamarindo Estates is a nice property, but overpriced for what it offers. The rental cars that are optional with a room reservation are in poor condition at best (old, beat up, no AC) and, given the even worse condition of the road to get to the hotel, I would recommend renting from Carlos Jeep Rental or other (newer vehicles, AC, automatic transmission). The room would be well priced about $20-40 less per night, and the property would receive 4/5.","ratings":{"Overall":3.0},"author":"Tyree Mosciski","date":"2013-08-01 14:18:07 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Eva Grimes"],"vacancy":true,"description":"A small, elegant inn.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
