The hotel is located near to the old airport in Kowloon - not the best of locations - looks run down - but will improve with time - as alot of building going on as in all of kowloon and Hong Kong. Location is good - transport cheap to get you to all the main attractions and shopping areas. Would stay again.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Gustavo Hyatt","date":"2015-08-12 23:15:35 +0300"},{"content":"very clean and nice hotel. close to Ibn battuta mall and quite area. all services are nearby","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Karlie Zboncak","date":"2015-11-03 01:37:30 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Elenor Rice","Adelle Jaskolski","Antonetta Wolff","Yvonne Kuvalis","Ellie Turcotte MD","Dwight Shanahan"],"vacancy":true,"description":"B&B with three double rooms.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":false,"free_parking":false}
