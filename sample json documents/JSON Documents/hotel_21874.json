Location: First and foremost the location is amazing. It's a little isolated from the more developed part of the island and that adds to it's exclusivity. Being surrounded by 4-5 beautiful beaches adds to it's aura. DT Fleming is right on the property and is heavenly. I highly recommend doing the Kapalua trail which is a little beyond the hotel. Service: The concierge service was excellent and prompt. We had one service mishap when on the very first night our room service order had to be given twice and it finally arrived 2 hours after we ordered it. But the food was good and they took it off our bill. Apart from this the service everywhere was superb. Property and Room: We had a partial sea and golf course view and it was beautiful! We could see the island of Molokai across the sea. I even caught a rainbow one morning after the daily morning shower, which is like a regular feature in Kapalua. The room was spacious, clean, well decorated and comfortable. Overall the property is very well developed with a sprawling golf course, spacious pool (though we didn't spend much time there - world class beaches were close by, remember?), tennis courts etc. Food and dining: On site there were quite a few options food. We only sampled the fare at The Terrace - good, solid breakfast/brunch and Banyan Tree - classy and loved the pea soup but not my entrÃ©e so much. But the location and feel at night is very relaxing. Spa: This is probably one of the best spa experiences I've ever had. Good enough for me to forget the 25 minute delay in the beginning. I appreciated the emphasis on relaxing, no rush to throw you out and the facilities available. My favorite - the exclusive, clothing optional hot tub for women which looked as if the room had been cut out of lava rocks. I had an excellent masseuse who was very careful since mine was a prenatal massage. Snorkeling: I wanted to mention my husband'd experience with the City under the Sea snorkelling excursion available by Ritz Carlton. Since this was his first time and he's not the best swimmer around so we wanted a guided service. The excursion was memorable for him. He was the only person taking the excursion that day so it was like a one on one experience. Kevin - the instructor was very knowledgeable and he took us through a presentation about reefs, how they are formed and the dangers facing them along with the wildlife there. He was an excellent guide and took some great pictures for us too. I would like to add that though I didn't go snorkelling I had gone along with them to the beach. He was very attentive especially after knowing that I was pregnant and included me in all the other activities. Environmental Consciousness: We appreciated the hotels efforts towards environmental consciousness and preservation. This was reflected everywhere. From their Ambassadors program to the room service. IMPORTANT WARNING: Please don't follow your GPS while driving from the airport to the hotel. It will take you through the unrecommended, dangerous and very narrow route through 340 via Honokohau. You should take 380 and come via Lahaina. Though the former route is beautiful it gets really treacherous at times and it's okay if you're prepared for it, but not after a 13 hour flight when you think you're in the middle of nowhere. The Ritz should mention this on their website. Overall a truly amazing vacation. I would return anytime!","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Service":4.0},"author":"Baby Aufderhar","date":"2014-11-29 20:25:11 +0300"},{"content":"I was impressed. We booked through priceline and got a great deal. We arrived early and the room was not ready until three, but the front desk provided us a fitness key to change and spent the afternoon by the pool/beach. Service was excellent. We are getting married in Maui next year and will be back at this hotel next year. Be ready to spend some money though, hotel room svc, and poolside bar is pretty pricey.","ratings":{"Overall":4.0},"author":"Hipolito Beatty","date":"2013-04-10 08:16:03 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed for a week and enjoyed every moment. It's a beautiful hotel which is luxurious, extremely clean and really well maintained. The staff couldn't do enough to make you feel welcome and make sure you get the most out of your stay: We were upgraded for the latter part of our holiday for our wedding and recieved a bottle of campagne and chocolate coated strawberries on our last night: a nice touch. There are several fantastic restaurants nearby with a courtesy mini bus running back and forth to take you there and pick you up if you fancy a change from the hotel restaurants (very pricey) The pool is wonderful with plenty of sun beds and it's just a very short ( and pretty) walk down to the most gorgeous beach ever: DT Fleming beach. The beach was never over crowded and the water was gorgeous for a swim. Sometimes it was a bit breezy but it was a warm breeze and we actually welcomed this on warmer days. We got married here and had a perfect day rounded off with a superb meal at the Banyan Tree. Kapalua is breathtakingly beautiful and I honestly can't fault this super hotel. Go there and enjoy!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Justine Lindgren","date":"2014-11-19 01:18:39 +0300"},{"content":"I must highly reccomend the Ritz Carlton in Maui. It took my breath away.. this is a dream stay. I went with my wife a couple of years ago and daydream of going again. The Hotel is located on the Pacific Ocean, the ambiance is tropical and dreamlike. The staff is beyond amazing. The showers are amazing, the robes are relaxing, the oceanside massages are glorious and the FRUIT in your room each morning is so good!!! The Hawaiian juices are unlike any others you've ever tasted and you get it free all day in the lobby. So.. get up and GO to Hawaii","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Vernice Wolf","date":"2015-07-23 20:18:25 +0300"},{"content":"great hotel ,great location, great staff.

We flew 4000 miles to Maui for a conference that was being hosted by a hotel in Lahaina. The room was just not what we were used to so the next morning we called the Ritz Carlton and were booked into one of the residences , which is a very luxurious 1 BR suite with LR. I think it was about 900 square feet. We've stayed at RC before, but this was an absolutely fabulous. As usual, the hotel was luxurious but understated if that makes sense. My wife relaxed while I drove the short distance to the conference daily, and I enjoyed coming into beautiful Kapalua from the frantic pace of Lahaina after my meetings. Thank you RC for saving our vacation. The remaining 7 nights in Maui were absolutely fantastic.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Stefan O'Connell","date":"2014-11-09 17:02:24 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Ludwig Johnston","Alessia O'Keefe","Austyn Kovacek","Agustina Heidenreich","Ms. Augustine Hauck","Mr. Bart Kuphal"],"vacancy":false,"description":"The Hilton is part of the CNIT convention centre.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
