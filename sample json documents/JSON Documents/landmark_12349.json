A range of excellent scenery and wildlife can be seen on the way, ranging from porpoises jumping under the dramatic mountain landscape of Arran, to birds of prey swooping above the rolling fields of central Bute, and deer in the rolling moorland of the north end. And of course, you don't have to walk it all in one day - for the most part accommodation and food can be found en-route.","geo":{"lat":55.7467,"lon":-5.015,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":12349,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Argyll and Bute","state":null}
