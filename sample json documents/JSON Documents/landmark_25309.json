{"title":"San Diego/Point Loma-Ocean Beach","name":"Sunset Cliffs","alt":null,"address":"along Sunset Cliffs Boulevard south of Ocean Beach","directions":null,"phone":null,"tollfree":null,"email":null,"url":null,"hours":null,"image":null,"price":null,"content":"A lovely setting, Sunset Cliffs is an excellent place for sightseeing, picnics, watching sunsets (as the name suggests) or just driving along the rim of the beautiful cliffs along Sunset Cliffs Blvd. There is also a rather secluded beach there, but it's swim at your own risk. It is quite popular with the more adventurous and seasoned surfer as the surf is rather rough for the area. Be warned, however, that there are no lifeguards at this secluded beach and it is only accessible by scaling a gently eroding (but long-standing) cliff face. Local surfers have been kind enough to provide a rope that aids in 'safely' repelling down the cliff face. Some upper body strength is required to return to the top.","geo":{"lat":32.7331,"lon":-117.25667,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":25309,"country":"United States","city":"San Diego","state":"California"}
