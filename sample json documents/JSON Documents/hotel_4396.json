Over half the group (8 of us) stayed at HI and everyone felt the place was perfect for our needs. The service is wonderful, and the rooms (we were in Fountain Kings) were spacious, comfortable and charming. The fireplaces got a lot of use because our weather was a bit cold and rainy! We held a wine and cheese party in The Wine Bar for the birthday girl, which everyone enjoyed. Kudos to Cheryl the bartender who managed to keep up with us and keep our group happy. We will definitely pick The Harvest Inn next time we are in Napa Valley.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Ms. Dorthy Keeling","date":"2012-05-03 04:47:39 +0300"}],"public_likes":[],"vacancy":false,"description":"Reasonable sized rooms, outdoor swimming pool.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
