It was only opened to the public in the 1980's when it became a charity.  The heat-sink caused by its thick walls, combined with the general waste heat of London itself, keeps the garden much warmer than it would otherwise be at this latitude.  Due to this, the garden contains the world's most northerly example of a grapefruit outside of a greenhouse, and the largest fruiting olive tree in the country.  The collection contains thousands of different plant species.  Opens late in midsummer and for some bank holiday Mondays.","geo":{"lat":51.485,"lon":-0.1628,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16356,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Chelsea_physic_garden.jpg"}
