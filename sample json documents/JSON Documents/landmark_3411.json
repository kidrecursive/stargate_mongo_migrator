The place was a hotbed for the who's who. The décor remains dark and sophisticated, highlighted by the classic brick walls, adorned with glossies of Hollywood legends. Step inside and one might close their eyes and feel the presence of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin holding court in one of the plush booths. And apparently, as research points out, every president since Kennedy has enjoyed a fine meal at La Dolce Vita. Nostalgia and presidential history aside, the food remains delightful; lasagna, veal, steak, capellini, risotto, linguini and so on – it's all here and it's quite superb.","geo":{"lat":34.067534,"lon":-118.409124,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":3411,"country":"United States","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"California"}
