The seabird centre has telescopes for viewing the thousands of gannets in their colony on the Bass Rock, as well as webcams in various locations around the Forth islands, for viewing other birds including puffins, guillemots, razorbills, kittwakes, eider ducks. The interpretive centre is well done, with lots to keep the kids entertained. The cafe here is one of the best places to eat in the town as well, with sea-view terrace in good weather. Best times to visit are May-Jul for nesting birds, or Sep-Oct for the baby seals.","geo":{"lat":56.06138,"lon":-2.71734,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":20601,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"North Berwick","state":null}
