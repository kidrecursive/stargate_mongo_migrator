Birmingham's only independent hostel features a central location only streets from The Bull Ring, and next to the nightclubs of Digbeth. Beds in a shared dorm can be found for as little as Â£9 if you've got a sharp eye out and both breakfast and various foods in the evening are included, making it the West Midlands only half-board hostel. It is in the oldest part of the city, right near where the original manor house once stood. The area can look a little uninviting (this is what you will find outside the very centre of this industrial city), but the hostel makes up for it by being socially inviting (films/football can be watched and they have a Wii, playstation and xbox) and, as mentioned, still being close to The Bull Ring. They offer nightly events such as quiz night, beer tasting, movie nights and disco, and the common room is probably the best around.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
