We found the location quiet, away from the higher end of Wailea and the hotel is older but our rooms were large and very clean. The beds extremely comfortable and the overall service excellent. We arrived New Years Eve and had tried to get into 5* restaurants in other hotels but they were all booked so we decided we would dine in the resort. Both my husband and I felt the New Years Eve chef's menu was one of the best meals we have had and we travel alot. For $52/pp we had a 3 course menu with wine pairings and the food was amazing especially the main course Beef Tenderloin. We are from Alberta Canada and know our beef and felt this was one of the best cuts. We didn't dine any other time so no comment on daily fare but the New Years Eve was special. I would recommend this hotel and would return.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Nettie Senger","date":"2012-02-06 05:17:56 +0300"},{"content":"My husband and I decided on a trip to Hawaii to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. We booked the trip through American Airlines Vacations in January, for travel in September. We chose the â€œ4-Starâ€� vacation package, which included 4 nights at the Maui Prince in Makena, and 3 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu. Throughout the time from January to September, I was in contact with various members of the concierge staff at the Maui Prince to plan activities for our stay. They were always so gracious and helpful, and I felt like a valued guest with every communication. Just before our trip, I learned that the Maui Prince was under new management (had become the Makena Resort), and got a little nervous about the reservations, but no worries! Everything was perfect from check-in to check-out. We were greeted with shell leis and refreshing cool towels, as well as a very friendly bell staff and front desk attendant who immediately wished us a happy anniversary and gave us an upgrade to our room at no additional charge. We were booked in a partial ocean view room, but got a beautiful ocean view room instead. It wasnâ€™t the â€œtop of the lineâ€� room, but it was ocean view, and we didnâ€™t have to pay extra! I cannot give enough praise to the staff, as they were all extremely friendly and helpful, and absolutely exuded the spirit of aloha, from the front desk to the pool bar, to the wait staff in the restaurants, and the housekeeping staff. Fabulous service â€“ always with a warm smile! The beach in front of this hotel is extremely beautiful and uncrowded. It is a small beach, but all the more cozy and private. I might add that this resort is on the southwest coast of Maui, not in the Kaâ€™anapli area up north, where it is apparently much more commercial. This resort is about a 30-minute drive from the airport. We were within 10-20 minutes of all the shopping we could ask for, from a Safeway shopping center to the Shops at Wailea, a very upscale shopping complex with stores like Gucci and Tiffanyâ€™s. The restaurants at the resort served absolutely incredible food. Be forewarned, everything in Maui is quite pricey, but if you know that before you go, there wonâ€™t be too many surprises. I just donâ€™t recommend ordering room service at the resort. One of the â€œmust-doâ€™sâ€� on Maui is a drive on the Hana Highway. Start early in the morning, though, because you will want to make several stops, and it will take you at least 4 hours to get to Hana, if there is light traffic. I recommend getting the CD-guided tour at the Shell station near the airport for $20, well worth it. There are some breathtaking views and gorgeous rainforest scenery along the way, and you will definitely want to see the black sand beach. If we had not gotten the CD package, we would have missed it. The Maui Prince/Makena Resort has a luau one night a week, but we were not there on the right night for it, so we went to the Honuaâ€™ula Luau at the Marriott just up the road for our anniversary dinner â€“ it was AWESOME! I highly recommend it, regardless of where you stay. The food and show are worth every penny of the $100+ per person cost. I would just really like for the staff of the Maui Prince/Makena Resort to know that they made our anniversary trip everything we dreamed it would be - the most wonderful, memorable, romantic trip we have ever taken. I just hope we can go back someday. Mahalo nui loa, Maui Prince/Makena Resort!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Augustus Frami I","date":"2014-01-21 00:31:06 +0300"},{"content":"We had wonderful time at the Maui Prince. We were able to get a two bedroom two bath suite for less than a regular room at most other hotels. The beach was uncrowed and the staff was fantastic. Kids eat free for breakfast and lunch and the food was great. The room was simple but very clean and comfortable. This hotel is a tremedous value. The pool is small but you will want to spend all your time at the beach. Grounds are very lush and very beautiful. We snorkled off the beach every day, and the sea turtles are 10 feet from the beach. Those that gave this hotel a poor review simply paid too much. For what we paid I would certainly go back. Do your homework, compare it to other resorts and book your stay with confidence, you will have a wonderful time.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Mr. Felicity Mann","date":"2014-04-07 08:30:01 +0300"},{"content":"We arrived at the Maui Prince after two days in Oahu at the Hawaii Prince and two days in Hotel Hana in Maui. It was our honeymoon which we planned several months in advance. We were looking forward to relaxing for 5 nights at the Maui Prince. First off, the bell men were beyond rude. They never welcomed us with leis as we saw others being welcomed. The moquitos run rampant there which we never had any problem with riding all over Maui. The floors and rooms were dirty. Obviously, they don't clean daily. The front desk was also rude. No Aloha spirit in this place which we had gotten accustomed to in other parts of the island. They gave us a pitiful view for our prime ocean view rate. Our shower made a loud banging noise which went from hot to cold to scalding hot while you showered. It also lost most the pressure during use. We asked for a room change or maintenance to fix which they said they did during our dinner. We tried out the hotel restaurant since it' s in the middle of nowhere. The food was mediocre at best with very high prices. The service from wait staff and hostess was also snobby. The other dinner restaurant was closed for renovation til July. We decided to leave the second day but they were going to charge us the early departure fee of one night stay so the manager upgraded us to ocean front room. The view was better, room larger and separate shower but it was old and dirty also. The pool was always hot and there is only one which we were used to several. If you want a nice place to stay, you can get a better rate in Lahaina or Ka-anapali Beach at the Westin, etc with better view and many pools and restaurants. I think people go there to have quiet, but it's not going to happen if that's your reason with the nightly bird convention in lobby and loud shower and faucets. It's falling apart and in need or an upgrade or serious rate adjustments. They charge daily rate for internet and plus additional charge for parking nightly. Rape you every way they can. NOt ideal for honeymoon at all.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Location":1.0,"Rooms":1.0},"author":"Mohammad Powlowski","date":"2012-08-29 22:49:39 +0300"},{"content":"What a great place. Other reviews have not been kind enough. The staff was great. Each time I wanted something, they had it right here, right now. Seemed to have plenty of privacy.

The Maui Prince was a fine choice for the price. We were there at the end of March and it looked like the place less than half full. We hardly saw any other guests present. The room was nice, it was also clean. We ate at the restaurant and enjoyed the quiet meal and good service. We also had the contiental buffet and it was your standard hotel buffet. If you like pretty tropical birds with your breakfast you will be entertained by them flying nearby. If you can get a good rate and want a nice quiet retreat you would be happy at this hotel.","ratings":{"Overall":3.0},"author":"Hillary Schmitt","date":"2015-07-02 07:13:29 +0300"},{"content":"My husband and I recently stayed at the Maui Prince hotel. We went to Maui to get married and to honeymoon. I must say, after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, they were pretty right on. Hotel The Maui Prince was great in that it was pretty secluded and quiet. The rooms were a little out-dated, but they were comfortable for our needs. The beds were nice and comfortable and everything in the room worked and was pretty clean. I would definitely recommend going for an oceanfront room. It was nice to keep the door open and sleep to the ocean (a luxury we don't get here in KY!) One thing I thought was strange was the water fountain in the garden. The grounds were very beautiful and well kept, but all we could hear until 8pm was the water fountain in the koi pond. The fountain didn't really serve a purpose and overshadowed the ocean for a while. Beach The beach was nice. We easily got lounge chairs and our pick of spots. There was even a guy from the hotel walking around making sure everyone had what they needed and offering cups of water. I would recommend taking a short drive south of the hotel to Big Beach state park. It was pretty empty when we were there and was very serene. Staff The staff was ok. It was nothing to rave about, but we didn't really have any problems. There is free valet parking (a tip of course is expected) or you can self park. I would recommend self parking. The parking lot is not far away and you save yourself the money for tips. However, the first day we arrived, the valets pounced on the car and seemed irked that we did not want to take advantage of their services (I was just being dropped off while my husband parked). Food To be honest, we only ate at the hotel once (excluding the luau). We ate at the pool grill after a day at the beach. The food was good, but pricey for what we got. Iwould highly recommend going to the Shops at Wailea for a couple of meals. Longhis was named \"best breakfast in maui\" and we couldn't agree more! Everything is homedmade, the service was great, and the atmosphere was laid back. I was hesitant at first because it looked like a fancy restaurant, but we saw people in everyhting from board shorts, to work out gear to resort wear in there for breakfast. I would also recommend have lunch or dinner at Cheeseburgers island style. Everything is ala carte on the menu. Also, if you're a pop drinker, I would get the bottomless mug. It pays for itself in 2 refills (refills are not free). If you're around any of the restaurants (wailea or lahaina), you can take the cup in for a refill. Each room has a minifridge in it. I would recommend going up to Safeway (on Pi'Ikea near Hilo Hatties) and get some drinks and snacks to keep in the room. It saves money and the hassle of running to a vending mchine. I apologize this review is lengthy, but I've always found Trip Advisor useful and wanted to share my experience.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Retha Swift","date":"2012-11-28 13:12:46 +0300"},{"content":"Before booking this stay, we checked many reviews. So we tought it would be ok, except when we got there...everything was amazing! First of all, I want to adress the issue of the decor. I know hotels in the States really focus on the rooms, while for us it's more about the overall experience. The rooms aren't new, but the furniture and design are very, very classy and eternal. If remodernised now, it would end up looking just like the other hotels. This one has an elegant soul. The whole layout of the hotel is wonderful. There's the spacious terraced lobby overlooking the internal garden and the koi carp pond, also the other hotel grounds were the most beautiful tropical garden there could be. The beach in front of it is also beautiful. The views of Molokini (specially sunset and sunrise) are quite something. It's a resort, but since we went there in September after Labor day, it wasn't crowded at all. That was also noted by other reviews. Since the sheer size of the hotel, we would never really grasp the number of people staying at the time. However, when we went to the morning yoga session on the lawn overlooking the beach, it was almost like having a private instructor. The staff in general was great, helped us with planning all our other activites in Maui. About the location, yes, it fells amazingly secluded since it's the last hotel in south Makena, close to some great looking beaches (Big Beach, Small Beach, La Perouse Bay is also nearby). But if you have a rental car, and you probably want to have it for you trip to Maui, you can reach Wailea in minutes, than take the highway bypassing Kihei and from there on to the other attractions of the island. We felt that if we were to stay in Kaanapali, the drive to the other sights would have been much longer, since the road to Lahaina isn't as fast as the highway close to Kihei. Just one caveat, the shack next to the beach renting snorkling gear & other equippment is overpriced. There are many great restaurants in Maui, so we didn't eat at our hotel up to our last night when we just ordered room service. We were again surprised, the food was very good and the menu quite imaginative (for a room service menu). The breakfast buffet is a bit pricey. We would love to stay at the Maui Prince Hotel again, I don't know what the standard rates are since we booked a package through an online service (although we feel it was a bargain for the superb quality of the hotel).","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Beryl Dietrich","date":"2015-07-19 04:27:49 +0300"}],"public_likes":[],"vacancy":false,"description":"Close to the shopping centres on Boulevard Haussmann-Printemps and Galeries Lafayette. 86 hotel rooms and suites, High-speed Wi-Fi available.
