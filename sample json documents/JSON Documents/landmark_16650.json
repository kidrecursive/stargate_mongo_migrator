An interactive experience, the museum challenges visitors to look inside themselves and assess their own levels of tolerance. This is the antidote to theme park burnout: the museum is highly interactive and engages kids (about 10 and older). Find your kids asking you about such things as racial and economic tensions. A highlight of the museum is priceless, live testimonies by Holocaust survivors. The Museum is a unique experience, creating the best kind of memories and interactions for families.","geo":{"lat":34.05361,"lon":-118.40145,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16650,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
