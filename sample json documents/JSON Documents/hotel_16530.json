Also, I want to clarify that we spent a lot of nights in non-chain type hotels, so we know how to survive without the standard curved shower curtain, or the standard Hilton Brand alarm on your night stand.... but the experience at At Wind Chimes was so terrible that I really need to talk about it. My wife booked 3 nights at At Wind Chimes 1 month in advance, and when she called the hotel to confirm a crib, she was told that we would be upgraded to the Acacia- wonderful! Call before arriving to know where to check in, they warned her. We got to San Juan, called and found out that the upgrade was fake â€“ back at At Wind Chimes we were! We got to At Wind Chimes. Check in was already troubled by this reverse upgrade, or downgrade. Owner denied any upgrade had ever been offered, and he told us that there are 4 different hotels in San Juan owned by the same owner of the At Wind Chimes. Acacia is right down the road, and is one of these co-owned hotels. Trust me, it is not even in the same category as At Wind Chimes. The look of the hotel is overall Caribbean authentic, at least from the outside. Some renovation was going onâ€¦not very convenient considering the Spring Break period. According to the owner the hotel was full. The swimming pool is in a corner next to the reception.. not very good looking. Not very inviting. Since we were traveling with a 9 month old baby, my wife had called ahead to make sure there was a crib for the baby. Our room at the Acacia was supposed to have a balcony (perfect for when baby went to bed). Our room at At Wind Chimes- not so much. No balcony, no space, very tiny room. We were so disappointed. First of all they asked us to provide the credit card to pay the whole amount. We thought it was for any incidentals, but then we were handed a receipt to sign for another payment. But hey- we already paid in full on Expedia! No, according to At Wind Chimes, we didnâ€™t. (We later checked online- yes of course we had, and we had to repeatedly ask for a refund). Our room was the very last one available (that's what they said). Our room was on the 2nd floor of the 2nd building. After 3 ramps of stairs (no elevator, but they have ground level rooms if you have mobility issues), we finally got to our room. The room was 10' x 10'. Air conditioner under the window 2' from the bed (great for my back...), the room smelled like mold, and it did not look very well cleaned. But the greatest surprise was that the restroom did not have a door (!?!?!) and the window of the bathroom was actually looking at the corridor where all the guests where passing by (the window could not be closed, and we realized quickly that you could hear everything going on in the bathroom from the outside...) The crib was first placed in one position, then moved to another to allow us to access the bed. With the baby, luggage, and us, it was like a puzzle... The smell of mold was still there by the way. Off course there was no balcony eitherâ€¦ so after 7:30 PM, our day was practically over. We had a stained pillow (replaced), dirty towels in the bathroom (replaced). At Wind Chimes really feels more like a hostel than a hotel. Just dirty, unkept and old in general. Internet connection was related to the Boat Bar which is part of the hotel. Connectivity was very poor, and worked only the first day. Speaking of the bar, it was closed for renovation. The carpenters were working from dawn to dusk and everything was happening right in front of our only window. You want to relax in peace, enjoy your time away, have a baby that takes naps? Tough. It was also very noisy with the traffic outside. Remember the window in the bathroom facing the corridor? The corridor has a large opening on the street, that was working as a funnel for all the noises that were easily entering our room every time of the day (and night). The smell of mold was still there by the way.. no matter how low you were trying to keep the air conditioning hoping to reduce the humidity.. it did not work at all. The safety of the room was extremely poor. The same key was opening too many doors... and the lock was very weak. We complained with the owner, but off course the answer was always the same: \"We are trying to find you a better room, We are fully booked, We are sorry, but no refunds...\". The second day I decided to go with our baby to the swimming pool. As I said the one at At Wind Chimes is not very inviting, but the owner told us that if we want we could go to the sister hotel (the Acacia), I decided to go there to see how it looks. The Acacia is a totally different story. No Smell of Mold (off Course!) and very beautiful. The swimming pool (that is actually a very large hot tub) is on the second floor. Once I saw the hot tub I could not believe that both hotels were actually owned by the same person... The Hot Tub is amazing! It is worth the fare for the hotel just by itself... luckily I found that it is not a real hot tub.. it is just a little bit warm.. Perfect temperature for the baby! We had a wonderful time. I had occasion to look into the rooms facing the pool while the doors where open for the cleaning. They have a big LCD, and very nice paintings. The doors are new, and the lamps are new as well. Very good looking, and very nice style. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, I had to go back to the smell of mold, the small room, and the air conditioning hammering my back all night long. A very good thing of the hotel is the location. You are 5 minutes walk from Kasalta Bakery (wonderful for snacks, breakfast, lunches), and many other small restaurants for the night. 10 minutes to the west, and you are in the center of Condado with hundreds of restaurants and bars. The bus stop is 5 minutes from there. Line #53 will take you straight to the old San Juan (amazing place!). The beach is literally 1 minute walk to the north. You can see the palms or the water at the end of the street. Again, let me reiterate- when I read negative reviews on TripAdvisor, I always think: these people expect too much, they are snobs, etc. However, this is unfortunately my true experience as an absolutely normal person. The level of decency is severely lacking at At Wind Chimes. Of course, as long as you do not like the smell of Mold! In that case, the At Wind Chimes is the perfect place for you! We were very happy to leave the At Wind Chimes to continue out trip around the wonderful island of Puerto Rico.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":1.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Katelyn Goodwin","date":"2014-06-11 15:08:58 +0300"},{"content":"MY partner and I needed a little get away and we chose this place based on a friend's recommendation. We are used to staying in Bed & Breakfast type accommodations and this was more hotel-like so it didnt meet our expectations regarding personalized service. Most of the desk staff was nonchalant and not especially friendly. The rooms were classic Caribbean with spartan furnishings and not up to US mainland standards for cleanliness...especially B & B standards of cleanliness. Loved being at the pool. It was a nice haven after being out in the hot PR weather all day. The \"sister\" hotel which was a block away had a huge hot tub available to Wind Chime guests. It was fun. There is supposedly a happy hour at the bar. We check several times while we were there at the designated time and no one was manning the bar. Not a critical thing.. but they shouldn't promote it. While some people would find this an okay place and we would consider it again, I believe we would likely try another accommodation before returning.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":2.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Service":3.0},"author":"Miss Price Von","date":"2014-10-05 21:57:46 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed here one night on our way to a cruise. The hotel is charming, and the neighborhood in which it is located seemed safe and clean, and convenient to the beach. Those preferring to tour old SJ may want to stay closer. The road it is on is quiet by day, but is busy and loud at night. Our windows did not close all the way, which did not really concern me, b/c they did have bars on them. We got a VERY small room next to the lobby, which made sleeping challenging (for me-my husband sawed logs all night.). Folks we were traveling with got an enormous room upstairs, so they are not all so small. The staff was friendly and helpful enough, but the surfaces of the rooms and bathrooms were not very clean. It looks like housekeeping does the bare minimum. Probably would not go back, but their cat is adorable.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Adolf Zulauf","date":"2013-09-02 08:01:23 +0300"},{"content":"You can tell this Inn was at one time a lot nicer. I knew this would be a no-frills stay when I booked it for just a night- which is FINE, we love Inns and B&B's so we expect certain short comings.The outside areas are really pretty with a traditional spanish colonial feel. The woman who checked us in was very nice and interesting. Everything was clean, although the room just felt dirty because it needed updating. The bolt lock on the door was missing, the door was all scratched and beat up. The tiles in the shower were old and discolored. I honestly think there are better values out there.
