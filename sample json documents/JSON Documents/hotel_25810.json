If you stay in the tower building you do not have to go outside to get to the water park. you can get anything you want to eat without leaving the building. The water park was fun for all ages. The lifguards patrol non-stop which is a good feeling.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Dalton Doyle","date":"2015-12-29 19:17:14 +0300"},{"content":"Nothing to complain about as far as the rooms were concerned. Never got any ice from the ice machine. I think there aren't enough ice machines for the number of guests. But other than that, it was a great time for our family. The water park was the highlight for us. Our kids are 4 & 7 yrs. old and both had a blast. We were traveling with friends, their children 3 & 13 yrs. old also enjoyed themselves. As far a the water temp. it was very comfortable during our stay. I hate cold water and won't swim if it is cold and that wasn't a issue.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Ryleigh Lang","date":"2012-12-15 14:20:47 +0300"}],"public_likes":[],"vacancy":true,"description":"Located conveniently on Lombard St and has newly renovated rooms.
