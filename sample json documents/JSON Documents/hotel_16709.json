It did feel a bit damp, however, as I have read in other reviews. The location was wonderful â€“ nice restaurants and bars nearby, and a nice walk to better beaches. The staff was very friendly and helpful but three things were wrong: 1) the website promised a coffee machine and CD player in the room, but they were not there and not provided after I mentioned it, 2) the doors of all rooms are incapable of closing quietly, therefore, there was a lot of slamming noises at all hours and 3) there was an all night party nearby which woke me up throughout the night until 4:00 a.m. I finally had to call the person at the front desk, who handled it promptly and successfully.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":3.0,"Service":4.0,"Rooms":3.0},"author":"Ladarius Fadel","date":"2014-04-29 15:36:34 +0300"},{"content":"The ONLY 1 good thing about this hotel is the location - it is located in the Condado area of San Juan, and located next door to the Wyndam Condado - which you have access to at the pool, casino, etc. I have read many reviews and prayed nothing would go wrong but my husband is more positive that I am so we stayed at the Regency - the price was right and since we stayed 5 nights and got 1 night free-we tried it. If you just need a place to rest your head, stay here - this MIGHT be the place for you. If you have a car - $5 per day. Positives: Staff is friendly and helpful, hotel is located next door to the Wyndam, balcony in the room with views, price was right for us since we did not want to spend a lot of money per night. Negatives: rooms smell of mildew, our toilet flodded day 2 -but we were switched to another room, whole hotel needs remodeling. Stay here at your own risk.","ratings":{"Overall":2.0},"author":"Concepcion Lind","date":"2012-12-03 00:06:50 +0300"},{"content":"I am so glad to see Tamarindo getting the reviews it deserves. This is a very special place - you wonâ€™t find anything else like it on Culebra. No wonder people return here year after year! This was our first time, but we will be back. When we arrived for a week in February, the place had been undergoing a process of rejuvenation. Everything was newly painted; repairs had been made; things looked fresh and clean. The new resident caretakers welcomed us and made us feel right at home. They were eager to accommodate our needs, and asked for our feedback. The atmosphere was friendly and relaxed. The three cottages on the â€œestateâ€� are spread out on a hillside facing Luis Pena Cay and the mountains of Puerto Rico beyond. It is a beautiful natural setting: quiet and peaceful. The sunsets and starry skies at night are spectacular. Each cottage has three units with (mostly) covered decks facing the water. The units are simple, but clean and adequate for two people. The covered deck is spacious and comfortable, with table, chairs and a charcoal grill. The bed is a standard double, and there is no hot water except in the shower, (which was not a problem for us, but something to be aware of). There are no cooking supplies provided (except coffee filters), but we found plenty of provisions at the local grocery stores and cooked most of our meals, with occasional forays out for dinner. The small freshwater pool down by the beach is a little oasis â€“ a place to relax, read and cool off after a day in the sun and saltwater. Although the beach at Tamarindo is rough coral, and getting into the water at low tide takes some practice (there is one good spot at the north end by the pool), the snorkeling is incredible. Green turtles feed in the eelgrass just off the beach, and a colorful variety of reef fish make their home in the coral. There are several other good snorkeling spots, notably Carlos Rosario, and the wonderful sandy beach at Flamenco, very near by. Tamarindo is not a resort and Culebra is not a resort island. For those like us, who avoid resorts and instead seek simple, unpretentious places to explore, swim, snorkel, walk, read and relax in beauty and tranquility, it was perfect! Thank you, Dennis and Gail, for your wonderful hospitality. Hope to see you next year!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Mr. Seamus Mertz","date":"2014-04-07 11:55:37 +0300"},{"content":"Nice & simple.
