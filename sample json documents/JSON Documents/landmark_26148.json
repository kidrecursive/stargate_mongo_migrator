Tour buses can get backed up here during the day, but it's a great place to really appreciate the city from above, especially at and after sunset. Temperatures up there can be quite a bit lower than in the rest of the city, so bring a jacket. Muni bus #37, a scenic ride from the Haight-Ashbury or Castro and Market streets, gets you close, so you only have to climb the last 120' up.","geo":{"lat":37.7525,"lon":-122.4475,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":26148,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
