After the first night with a \"city view\" room and three freight trains in the morning, we upgraded to a water view room for $50/night. The room was larger, had a balcony and a great view of the harbor and the Olympic Mountains beyond. Breakfast was not inexpensive but was very good as was the view from the restaurant. I thought the four stars was a bit of a stretch - the rooms and hallways were in need of some updating. In all - a great stay.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Jaylin Denesik","date":"2015-08-11 05:12:15 +0300"},{"content":"I got the Hotwire rate and despite emailing reservations (always worth a shot0 could not score a waterfront room, but still had a decent view. Better than I expected for about 100 CDN, really cool and unique lobby, good rooms, convenient free shuttle that will take you anywhere for free (anywhere DT). The BEATLES stayed here in the late 60's and fished from the hotel windows, it's REALLY on the WATERS EDGE!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Rocky Kuvalis","date":"2014-04-11 09:10:19 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Kaden Bergstrom","Eulah Crona"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Very close to the airport","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":true}
