This is perhaps the most spectacular collection of European impressionism in the world—breath-taking rooms full of Manet, Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh, and many others. Impressionist represent the biggest draw, but there is much more to explore.","geo":{"lat":48.85998,"lon":2.32651,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":21801,"country":"France","city":"Paris","state":"Île-de-France"}
