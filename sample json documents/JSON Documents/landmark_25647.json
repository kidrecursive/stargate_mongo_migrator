Still owned and managed by the Pompei family, who started the restaurant in 1946. For those not interested in seafood, they offer two steaks and four chicken dishes, as well as three meatless pasta dishes and a meatless risotto.","geo":{"lat":37.8081,"lon":-122.4181,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":25647,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
