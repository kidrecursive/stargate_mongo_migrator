Two symmetrical buildings stare at each other across a courtyard, the length of which runs a wide river which reverses into a pool and, through a small waterfall, down towards the dining hall seating area. The building is surrounded by a moat, and sports orange trees in the courtyard. In addition, many doors are deliberately unlabeled to encourage scientific exploration. The Salk gives tours, but you must schedule them (they are early in the morning).","geo":{"lat":32.88706,"lon":-117.2457,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25176,"country":"United States","city":"San Diego","state":"California"}
