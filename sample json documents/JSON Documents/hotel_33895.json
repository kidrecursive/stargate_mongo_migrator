Maybe...Again The Paradisus Punta Cana resort was beautiful. Me and my wife stayed at the resort from October 14-20, 2007 for our honeymoon. The sites and service was great. The all-inclusive package is the way to go. All food, drinks, room service, nightly shows, and much more was included. The only problems we had was that our room was wrong when we arrived. We asked for one king bed and recieved two full beds. We just pushed them together instead of changing rooms and repacking everything. Also our room had a terrible ant problem. Each day there were ants in the bathroom and if we left room service left overs out, the next morning there would be lots of ants. Other than the ants, everything else went great. Very friendly people and even though the language barrier was a little difficult, the workers knew enough english for us to recieve what we needed or wanted. The only thing that may hold me back from going again is the language barrier. Beautiful and extravegant place!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Helen Buckridge","date":"2014-04-11 10:50:01 +0300"},{"content":"Gorgeous but not fantastic - gorgeous beaches  grounds - very humid! - a lot of spanish workers - not a lot of information given to you so you have to take it upon yourself  - food not very good (we went to the buffet for dinner quite a bit) - family memeber got sick so just be careful (but don't eat only salads because we were told that could have been it) - very good  thorough doctor - stay hydrated - use sunscreen! - stay on the beach, there is a breeze. pool is pretty but way too hot over there - kayaking in the ocean sounds fun but it really hurts your [lower] back so I wouldn't recommend it  - parasailing is very good. wish it could be longer, but very good. worth it, I would say. - if you want more privacy on the beach, I recommend going downs toward the north end of the beach (left if your looking at ocean); a lot more space even though it is a bit further from the bars (it was close to our room so it worked out great, plus you're right next to the water sports) - on your door, you can put on a card that says do not disturb (like in most hotels here) but we were not told we had to have it flipped over to where it said, 'please make up the room.' our room was still being cleaned every day but on the third night they didnt come at all and it was 10pm and our room was still not done all because of the sign which was never a problem before, so to be sure when you leave in the morning $@!#% it over to that side - massages were pretty good (had better, had worse). they give you this little robe though so for men I recommend wearing the towel they give you around you first then the robe. - don't buy anything on the beach it's a rip off. the gift store in the lobby is your best bet. it is quite expensive, but surprisingly its a bit cheaper than in the airport.  - the tv in the room gets channel nbc 4! so it was nice to wake up to the 'today show' and one of the only english speaking ones. (it also gets cnn, a fuzzy fox news, and a few others) - someone had mentioned that a 5 star to them is like a 3 star to us...couldn't agree more. coming from jersey our expectations were a bit too high for this much slower paced and carefree society","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":2.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Misty Kemmer","date":"2012-01-04 19:10:32 +0300"},{"content":"Great Vacation My husband and I along with another couple had a great time at the Paradisus Punta Cana from June 2nd to June 7th. I am certainly looking forward to returning for a longer stay.If you are looking for a truly relaxing vacation this is the place. The ambiance of the hotel is laid back and peaceful. The grounds are beautiful and nicely kept. The hotel is surrounded by mangroves so if you decide to walk from place to place you are on a constant nature walk. Staff was very friendly and helpful hour host Luis was very nice. We had a small suite with a balcony by the pool. The room was spacious, the furniture is beginning to show its age, but it is not in bad shape. We had dinner in the Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and French restaurants. They were all nice. We liked the Chinese place the best. We had reservations for the Japanese restaurant but I did not like the feel of it so we left. Breakfast was plentiful with a good combination of local food such as mangu (mashed plantains) and American fare.Lunch buffet was very nice with a good selection of varied food.Beach was good. More waves than I expected but still nice. Make sure you get to the beach early otherwise you miss out on the big beds under the huge umbrellas. My suggestion to the managers ( I hope they read these) is more beach umbrellas, the sun gets very hot in the afternoon and you need the protection. Night life is quiet, the hotel staff does nightly shows that are quite entertaining if somewhat cheesy ... but all in all again, you are there to have a good time not as a Broadway critic.So again, I am very much looking forward to another stay at this hotel. The area is full of beautiful looking places, but why mess with success ?The one negative in my opinion was the hotel's pitch to sell you a time share. It is hard to say no and I felt forced to listen to a sales presentation even though we had been very honest about the fact that we had absolutely no interest in their product. So make sure that you say NO from the get go when your host starts offering you gifts, etc. Unless you are interested in time sharing and many people are ... dont waste your time.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Check in / front desk":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Marlon Medhurst","date":"2013-03-30 14:25:18 +0300"},{"content":"Room thefts Vacationed at Paradisus Punta Cana 6/11-6/14/07.Hotel was very nice-beautiful grounds, friendly service, food average. Overall would have said it was a very nice vacation. Two major problems: 1. We arrived at 1pm, check in is not until 3pm. We did not get into our room until 4pm- we travelled during the off season-so the resort was not crowded, reception repeated told us our room was not cleaned yet and kept advising us 15 more minutes, a familar story that was also told to other guests that we spoke to duing our stay. 2. The day we checked out, we got to the airport when I realized I had left a bag which contained a battery charger to my digital camera in a draw in my room, as soon as I got home I phoned the resort and spoke to 2 people in lost and found who told me nothing was turned in. I then spoke with a manager and was told he spoke to housekeeping and was told nothing was found in the room. So obviously the bag was stolen and not reported to the lost and found-which is very dishearting because the bag was a cheap cavas bag w/ only a battery charger in it. I was also told by another guest who had left some costume jewerly out on her dresser, which was stolen as well and when she reported it stolen the manager told her to call the local police and was of no help. So be careful about what you leave out -use your safe and triple check your room before checking out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Business service":3.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Check in / front desk":1.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Enrico Hettinger IV","date":"2015-03-26 08:46:32 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Sheila Waelchi III"],"vacancy":true,"description":"The Bridalveil Creek campground is located along the road to Glacier Pass and is open from July through early September.
