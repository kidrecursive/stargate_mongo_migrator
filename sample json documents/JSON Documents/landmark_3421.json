Still, the easygoing vibe and cool, sophisticated environment keeps the bar relatively mellow, even when it's crowded – which it usually is. In all the spacious design and warm, comfy décor' (two fireplaces!) makes it a fine place to relax and socialize.","geo":{"lat":34.072609,"lon":-118.395201,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":3421,"country":"United States","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"California"}
