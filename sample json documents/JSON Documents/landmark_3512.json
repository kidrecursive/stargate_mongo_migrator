The first church was probably Norman, but was rebuilt in the 13th century. As it stands today, most of the church dates from 1875, though inside you can see the 1325 effigy of the Lord of the Manor Sir William de Bermingham. The church is a Grade II* listed building in the UK.","geo":{"lat":52.47695,"lon":-1.89323,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":3512,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Birmingham","state":null}
