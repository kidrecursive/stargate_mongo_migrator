We are always looking for interesting places to stay, so we decided to give it a try. The location is convenient since it is located on the Central Square and the \"ice cream\" parlor is definitely a highlight. Twenty-four hour security parking is available, so be sure to ask at check in. The hotel was in fact old and certainly gave us a view of Ponce during its more glamourous years. However, the rooms were disappointing. The furniture is old, which isn't bad since it is an old hotel, but there are stains on the cushions. I asked for my room to be changed when the bathroom floor did not appear to have been clean, and numerous hairs were found on the bed. The room I was changed to was not much better, but since we were only staying one night, we decided to settle in. This is truly unfortunate because the hotel has much potential but seriously needs some TLC and better housekeeping. On a more positive note the continental breakfast was quite good consisting of fresh pastries, juice, and coffee. The staff was also very accommodating and assisted us with many inquiries about the area.","ratings":{"Overall":2.0},"author":"Camron Kuhlman","date":"2012-10-21 08:26:13 +0300"},{"content":"We buy a Gustaso to stay in thi hotel ....

When we arrived at Perichiâ€™s, the first view of the hotel where hanging mattresses that resembled the hanging Gardens of Babylon. We all thought, â€œoh well, they are renovatingâ€� so we didnâ€™t put much thought into it. When we got our keys, accompanied with a generic TV remote, I grabbed our baggage and quickly went to our room to try to get a hot shower after a day of sight seeing. Walking towards the room, I saw that the doors seemed old and rustic; I thought it was part of the ambiance. When I opened the door of the room the hurricane sounding air conditioning was on and the moist/molded/cigarette air embalmed my nostrils with pizzazz. The bed covers had a huge unidentified stain right in the middle of the bed. I quickly took the covers and threw them in the corner of the room. When I do a 360 look around the room, I thought I was in the movie Trainspotting. The walls where stained and cracks where noticeable on the ceiling. When I enter the bathroom there was a blue toilet bowl from the 60â€™s accompanied by a blue sink and blue tub. I have to say that the blue matched perfectly with the blue â€œflower powerâ€� tiles on the wall. I walked back to the room and noticed that they where triangle shaped patterns on the rug. When I took a closer look, I realized that they where hot iron marks. It seems that a several guests left the iron on the floor. After I laughed and told many times to my girlfriend that I was sorry, we laughed and played along with the hotels crack house theme. I went to the front desk to complain about the room and they just stared at me like I was speaking Cantonese. For the record, Iâ€™m from Puerto Rico and my primary language is Spanish. The morning after our arrival we ate breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast was good and I cannot complain about the service. While I was eating, I was looking at the people that where working on the renovation of the hotel. They where spreading a roll of carpet. What was strange is that the carpet seemed old. Then I realized that they where replacing the old carpet with used carpet. Of course, how can you keep a Crack House themed hotel working with new carpet or new appliances. Maybe they just leave the carpet in sea water for days and employ people to intentionally burn the carpets with hot irons just for looks. Overall I have to say that the hotel is a mess, I stayed in the room in the front of the hotel and they seem to be the worst ones in the premises. The staff was nice although the administration keeps the place looking cheap and tasteless. Itâ€™s very sad that on this part of the island there is a limited amount of choices when it comes to hotels or bed&breakfast. My advice is, spend 20 dollars more and stay somewhere else. This is definitely not worth the money. Maybe they should change the name from Perichiâ€™s to Perishâ€™ s.","ratings":{"Overall":1.0},"author":"Miss Josh Fritsch","date":"2012-07-29 19:24:48 +0300"},{"content":"We have just returned from our lovely stay at Posada Porlamar.....where to start..we got a wonderfull room with an incredible view of the Caribeann Sea...we dinned at the hotel restaurant La Pared.... we had a great dinner, ostrich!!! in a white wine reduction...There are no words to describe it....Last but not least, the employees at Posada Porlamar made us feel like family ...We are definitely going back next summer...Two thumps way up!!!","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Frieda McKenzie","date":"2014-12-02 10:56:11 +0300"},{"content":"Location is great.

For 2011/2012 Christmas & New Years holiday we decided to make it special. We wanted to spend it on the island. We had stayed at the San Juan Beach several years ago when they were under renovations. We took that into consideration and put up with the inconveniences, it was a good stay. So we looked at the web site for 2011 and saw what appeared to be new pictures of completed renovations, and booked a 10 day stay. WOW!! What a shock we got when we arrive to find that the owner(s), shifted the emphasis from customer service to greed. The lobby was beautifully redone although simple. A restaurant El Perurrican) had been added, but you must be into strictly seafood (Not much diversity). The free breakfast that was served during our last stay was done away with. We assumed too make way for much better accommodations. WRONG! When we entered the room what a shock we got to find that it smelled musty, was very dirty and with stained carpets. The bathroom was full of mold, mildew, and rust. All the bathroom fixtures had mold, mildew and rust. The window shades were broken so you had to take them down and roll them by hand. The air conditioner (although it worked) sounded like a freight train all night, so we convinced ourselves that it was the sound of the ocean in our room so that we could sleep. We did have an ocean view room (which we payed extra for) We could not get room service to leave us clean towels, and the sheets were not changed. Only the bed was remade again and again for 10 days with the same sheets. I believe we had bedbugs, because we were itching all night an in the morning we both had bites all over our bodies. (we marked the sheets, to make sure). No coffee machine, NO blow dryer although the blow dryer plate was attached to the wall. On the third day we took a ride on the elevator, and were joined by 4 housekeepers. I am Puerto Rican and speak the language my wife is Irish/Italian and only understands it a little bit. Well these 4 housekeepers were discussing in Spanish, how pissed (Encojona) they were that, tourist would not leave the hotel until noon or after, thus causing them to be delayed in their duties. And that they could not find a room on a higher floor where they could watch TV and rest. At check out they attempted to charge us for 10 days of valet parking at $18 a day knowing full well that we only used the valet parking for 7 days, the valets were very good and pleasant . When we did try to launch a complaint the only person we could find did not appear to care about our problems. One employ did tell us that the new management did not appear interested in pleasing the customers only profit. NEVER AGAIN!! Beautiful Condado area, but book at your own risk.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":2.0,"Sleep Quality":1.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Adolfo Zboncak","date":"2015-03-06 21:55:28 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Deondre Leffler","Zander Bartell","Zelda Murazik","Marjorie Welch"],"vacancy":true,"description":"This picturesque, five-star hotel is a popular destination for weddings, as well as a playground to the affluent.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
