It's often termed the &quot;Mother of All Parliaments&quot; - an exaggeration, but perhaps only a slight one. The present building largely dates from the 19th century when it was rebuilt following a fire in a splendid example of Victorian [[Gothic architecture|neo-Gothic]] architecture. The House of Commons (elected Members of Parliament or MPs) is located to the north of the building and is decorated with green leather upholstery, and the House of Lords (unelected Lords) is located to the south and decorated with red leather upholstery. | image=Westminster Bridge, River Thames, London, England.jpg","geo":{"lat":51.4992,"lon":-0.1247,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16467,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Westminster_Bridge%2C_River_Thames%2C_London%2C_England.jpg"}
