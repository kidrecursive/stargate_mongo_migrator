The area near the Termini station is not the prettiest, but it is very convenient if you are using public transportation. My suggestion when exiting Termini station is to go RIGHT and walk down about 4 blocks and then right again and over 2 blocks. We were travelling with quite a bit of luggage and we ended up going the wrong way too many times. We had no problems in the area and loved the convenience of the location. We walked to Termini to either pick up the Metro train or a bus to most all of the sites. The room was spotless and the Breakfast was delicious. Assunta - the owner, could not have been more helpful, although her sense of direction is not like ours in America. Just a short walk maybe a lot longer than we Americans are used to. Hoping on the #70 bus gets you to almost any tourist site (or close to) and most buses all head back to Termini.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Hermina Schinner","date":"2015-03-06 22:56:15 +0300"},{"content":"This motel may not be the Ritz Carlton but if your looking for value, a great location and safe neighborhood then you've chosen the right place! It is right across the street from the CBS studios, the line for the price is right is just around the corner. My son and I stayed there for a week and received great service from the maids right on to the front desk. The front desk was more helpful than any concierge I have ever seen and they are just a wonderful hard working family. If I ever go back to LA I will definitely stay at the Beverly Inn even if it's only for the friendly service.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Jose Swaniawski Sr.","date":"2014-02-12 20:15:16 +0300"},{"content":"This place is car motel that has seen much better days; the beds are old and offer no support, the televisions, carpets, and furnishings are likewise well-used, and the overall effect can be somewhat depressing. However, it does offer limited parking and convenient location at a very inexpensive rate and the bathrooms were clean; it attracts tourists who are more interested in the surrounding neighborhoods (which are quite nice with wonderful restaurants) and less interested in where they stay for the night. There was a cafe down the street when I was there in 2002, it's along major bus lines, with a terrific market close by across the street. It is also right across from the CBS studios, and about four blocks walking from an old-style diner and bakery. The comments on other sites focus on the ethnic background of the clerks and manager, but I found them pleasant and accommodating. That is why I actually felt safe there as a single female traveler (although I suspect others would not feel this way). This is just slightly above average for what you would expect for the price, but you do get what you pay for.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":3.0,"Rooms":2.0},"author":"Mr. Ellis Heller","date":"2012-03-02 00:20:56 +0300"},{"content":"Dirty, cock roach infested, unsafe, and very noisy. This motel has not been updated in 25 years or more. It is very noisy (even with ear plugs) because you are a stone throw away from the Dolphin Expressway. The carpet and ceramic floors are filthy along with the furniture and bedding. Someone tried entering my room in the middle of the night, thank goodness for deadbolt and door chain. Photos online are very deceiving. RECOMMEND - DO NOT STAY AT THIS MOTEL. This motel should not be part of the Choice Hotel chain. Should be called \"Last Choice\".","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":1.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":1.0},"author":"Lottie Gerhold IV","date":"2014-06-12 22:56:30 +0300"},{"content":"Creepy, dirty, dark, depressing. It looks like the stereotypical motel in the movies where a drug deal goes bad and people get murdered. Rooms smell of chemical perfumed disinfectant and it burns your nose and lungs... but you will be too afraid for your safety to open a window or door! We stayed at this hotel from 3pm to 10pm (never actually slept overnight, thank god!) because we had a late night flight and it was pouring rain in Miami. The hotel says it's \"newly renovated\" and had free WIFI, so we figured it would be a nice place to spend a few hours and relax. HA! NOOOO! We laid on top of the beds, just to watch tv and instantly became itchy. Nothing about this hotel was \"newly renovated.\" The WIFI was extremely slow. The main picture of this hotel is deceiving. It looks a LOT worse and run-down in real life! Don't bother with this place.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":1.0,"Rooms":1.0},"author":"Niko Keebler","date":"2014-12-12 12:32:09 +0300"},{"content":"We didn't stay at the hotel so I can't comment on the rooms. We did leave our car there while we went on a cruise ($5/night parking.) While we were gone someone siphoned ALL of the gas out of our vehicle. I have called the manager twice to alert her to the problem. I've left messages concerning \"a security issue at the hotel\" and no one has returned my call. I guess they don't care about security. Next time I will spend the $20/day to park at the port since that seems to be the only secure parking to be had.","ratings":{"Overall":1.0},"author":"Miss Alysha Goldner","date":"2012-01-17 00:40:45 +0300"},{"content":"I stayed at this motel for one night with my partner in August 2010. We had a flight early in the morning from Miami airport so we wanted a hotel close to the airport. I booked this through BOOKING.COM and payed Â£45. I have never stayed in Miami before so we did not know what areas were good and what was bad. When we checked in I wasa little concerned as there was a security hut and a guard at the door. We checked in and it was very run down and dirty. They asked for a credit card but I insisted on paying cash as there was no way I was going to hand over my card details. We parked our car and tried to find our room. The halls were all outdoors and very run down. There was a sign saying it had just had a refurb. I could not see where from the outside. It seemed that the area in Miami the motel was in was not a very good one, this concerned us a little. We finally found our room and went in. The room was very basic and smelt of damp. The dead lock on the door was broken and there was no safe in the room. We felt that uncomfortable that at night we pushed our suit cases up to the door. The shower had no presure and was only luke warm and the paint was peeling off from the bathroom. What really appauld us was the floor. I took my shoes and socks off and was walking around in bare foot. After two minutes my partner said \"LOOK AT YOUR FEET\". They were black. The floor was that dirty that in 2 mins my feet were black. I wet a towel and rubbed it along the floor. The towel changed to black and the carpet changed colour. The floor could do with a really good clean. The TV reception was very poor and fuzzy and we gave up in the end. Also the internet/Wifi had little/no signal. It was noisey outside and there were Police sirens sounding all night outside. We found it hard to sleep. We only stayed the night as we had to get up at 4 am to check in for our flight and we checked in at 8pm that evening. Otherwise we would have moved hotel. The only plus side was it was close to the airport. We did not stay for the breakfast but if itn was anything like the room we would have passed anyway. We did not use the pool as it was on the otherside of the motel right next to a main highway. It looked dirty and very uninviting. Please only stay at this motel if you have to or if it is free and you are feeling brave.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":1.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Miss Weldon Flatley","date":"2015-05-21 14:38:02 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Ms. Jaleel Bartell","Rodger Jerde","Hanna Simonis"],"vacancy":false,"description":"1 George IV Bridge.
