Home to no less than 70 million specimens from across all the life sciences. It's difficult to say what the most popular exhibit here is; the diplodocus which towers over the entrance hall, the (now slightly tacky-looking) animatronic tyrannasaurs in the dinosaur gallery, or the life-size model blue whale in the mammals gallery. Also well worth a check are the recently-opened Darwin Centre (book on a free tour to see some of the most interesting, and sometimes gruesome, specimens not on public display); and the studio dedicated to BBC wildlife personality extraordinaire, David Attenborough. The NHM's &quot;Earth Galleries&quot; were once the adjacent Geological Museum, an independent institution until the 1980s, and still located in a separate building with a separate entrance.","geo":{"lat":51.495983,"lon":-0.176372,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16353,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":""}
