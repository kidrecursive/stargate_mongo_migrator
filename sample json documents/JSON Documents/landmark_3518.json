{"title":"Birmingham (England)","name":"Curzon Street station","alt":null,"address":null,"directions":null,"phone":null,"tollfree":null,"email":null,"url":null,"hours":null,"image":null,"price":null,"content":"The Curzon Street station was the original main railway station of Birmingham, offering connections to London since 1838 and to Liverpool and Manchester since 1839. It was quickly overshadowed by the original Birmingham New Street station built in 1854, and saw less and less traffic ever since, becoming a goods station only in the 20th century, before being put completely out of use in 1996 with its tracks later dismantled.&lt;br&gt;The only surviving remainder is the solitary small station entrance building, which is Grade I listed and quite elegant in form. As of 2014, it stands next to an open plot of land resulting from the removal of station tracks, platforms and other infrastructure, which is awaiting redevelopment. The building is not open for visiting and only occasionally hosts arts events and such.","geo":{"lat":52.48158,"lon":-1.88639,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":3518,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Birmingham","state":null}
