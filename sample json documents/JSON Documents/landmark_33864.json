(Note: this waterfall is often dry from August through October.) The eastern part of the loop is wheelchair accessible.  Since the trailhead falls on the Northside Dr, it's better to see the falls on your way out of the Yosemite Valley.","geo":{"lat":37.745683,"lon":-119.593626,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":33864,"country":"United States","city":"Yosemite Valley","state":"California"}
