At the same time Arbeia was the central supply unit for the entire Roman troops on Hadrian's Wall. Situated above the Tyne in South Shields there is the excavation site. The main reason for visiting is the distinctive reconstructed West Gate which gives an excellent impression of the dimensions of such a system. Near the gate the commander's home was reconstructed, which gives an impression of the relative wealth of upscale military of that time with numerous murals. A museum with shop and an education center form the entrance to the castle grounds.","geo":{"lat":55.00389,"lon":-1.43196,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":39128,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"South Shields","state":null}
