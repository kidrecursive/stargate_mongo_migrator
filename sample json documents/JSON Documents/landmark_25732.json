It specializes in indie and international films.  It's a small little theater, with smallish seats and an even smaller screen; but its got a cozy atmosphere, its popcorn comes laden with butter, and overall it's a great place to catch an art house film.","geo":{"lat":37.7905,"lon":-122.4344,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":25732,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
