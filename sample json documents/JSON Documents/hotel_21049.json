Rooms small and dated (bathroom- think cruise ship) but typical for a city location. What really ruined my weekened was the 3 calls a day I needed to make to security to report my neighbors on the 7th floor who were smoking non stop. Colleagues reported the same on the 8th and 14th floors. Our clothes, towels and linens really smelled bad. The hotel is non smoking and has a fine policy but clearly this not enforced, Worse is that in such an old building, a fire would be a disaster. The hotel needs to be proactive and police their smoking guests!!!!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":3.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Edna Considine Sr.","date":"2015-05-15 00:54:58 +0300"},{"content":"This was the second we stayed at this hotel in the past five years. The location is great with the green line a block away and the commuter rail about four. The lobby is beautiful and has the golden era ritzy feel. The rooms are small and need a little freshness (the hotel opened in 1927). Service and staff are helpfull, polite and professional. Parking, room service and the restaurants are pricey; there are better deals elsewhere (MJ O'Connors). We stayed on the coldest days since 2006 and the hotel had some heating issues (along with the rest of the city). They did what was humanly possible to help and it really wasn't an inconvience. Would I stay here again? Yes for the right price. If you go in the warmer times of year you can walk to almost everything. And if you can't walk the green and red lines are nearby.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Eldora Bayer","date":"2013-04-13 03:05:52 +0300"},{"content":"Staying at this hotel was fantastic and a highlight of my honeymoon to the USA everything was top shelf and reasonably priced. We stayed in the Towers suites and would recommend to anyone.
