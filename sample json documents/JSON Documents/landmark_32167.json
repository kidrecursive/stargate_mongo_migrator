The bar manages to be both casual and hip, with the crowd tending towards well-to-do 20 and 30 somethings.  Dark, but not too dark with a good selection of modern alternative music in the background (at times a tad too loud).  Lots of seating area, but the spots by the windows are prized.  Bar has menu's for local delivery options and pretty waitresses.  Earlier on warm evenings, the windows are opened giving a very open, breezy feel to the place.","geo":{"lat":33.9915,"lon":-118.46935,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":32167,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
