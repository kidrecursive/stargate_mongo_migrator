Below the summit on the Castleton side the old main road has been abandoned after repeated landslides; the ruined road is worth seeing, as are the remains of Odin Mine at its foot. From the Mam Nick car park above Winnats Pass it's less than half a mile's walk to the summit; from there a fine ridge walk leads east to Lose Hill (2¼ miles one-way). From Mam Nick a mildly spectacular road leads over into the [[Edale]] valley. Rushup Edge/Lord's Seat (west of Mam Nick) is a popular site for paragliders.","geo":{"lat":53.3492,"lon":-1.8097,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":5197,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Derbyshire","state":null}
