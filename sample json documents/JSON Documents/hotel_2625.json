It was more than a great condo....Very very spacious and very clean with a typical American furniture. It has jaccuzi in the master bathroom. You really feel you are at home. The location is very close to Disneyworld but it can be bit difficult to reach especially at night. If you get lost, just ask for Nickelodeon hotel and it is very close to it. They have a great swimming pool and a nice gardens. It has a small supermarket and there is an outlet just outside the resort. This is the ideal place to stay if you travel with your family and don't want to spend too much staying at the very expensive Disney resorts. It is the ideal place to stay especially for a long holiday in Orlando...You can use the internet for free from your condo and you will have a free parking outside your door.... I loved this place and for sure will stay here again.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Reece Heller","date":"2013-10-03 18:58:17 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Adolfo Bode"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Single ensuite rooms Â£35.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":false,"free_parking":true}
