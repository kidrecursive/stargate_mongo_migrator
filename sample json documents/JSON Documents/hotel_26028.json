The staff was exceptional - ALWAYS very professional and courteous. The rooms were great; open, spacious and modern, and the fireplace was a nice bonus. Perfect for taking off the slight chill on rainy Seattle days. I definately would recommend this hotel.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Providenci Batz","date":"2015-02-23 05:51:51 +0300"},{"content":"Spot on hotel. Massive room with great views, great management and staff, excellent location. We shopped, went to a baseball game, went to the Pike Market, and took the Clipper home, which is close by. Handy shuttle service, and cheap for cab trips. Breakfast was a definite bonus. Loved our entire stay and have not one remotely negative thing to say. We will definitely stay here again when we go back.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Rory Anderson","date":"2014-05-16 04:58:17 +0300"},{"content":"What a great experience.
