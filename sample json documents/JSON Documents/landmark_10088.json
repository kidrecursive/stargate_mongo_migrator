If you want to create your own art, enrol for evening classes or the summer school. The original building on the campus was seen as one of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's finest buildings, housing one of Britain's pre-eminent schools of art, design and architecture. In May 2014, the Mackintosh building was closed for the foreseeable future due to a major fire which damaged the west wing of the building (that had been added 1907-09), destroying the library. Efforts are ongoing to salvage damaged art works. Due to the closure the original building tour no longer takes place. However a new external tour ('''[http://www.gsa.ac.uk/visit-gsa/mackintosh-at-the-gsa-tour/ Mackintosh at the GSA Tour]''') is available and tells about Mackintosh's role at the Glasgow School of Art. The tour lasts 1 hour.","geo":{"lat":55.86609,"lon":-4.26376,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":10088,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Glasgow","state":null}
