It was established in 1771, pre-dating the Pueblo of Los Angeles by several years. Between 1771 and 1834, more people were baptized at Mission San Gabriel than any other mission. Today, the church and grounds have been restored and contain a small museum, as well as a playhouse originally built for productions of ''The Mission Play''. The first Saturday of each month features special programs. This mission is one of the smaller missions and can be seen in 1 or 2 hours.","geo":{"lat":34.09688,"lon":-118.106611,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":37507,"country":"United States","city":"San Gabriel","state":"California"}
