No tipping and very courteous - conceirge service was exceptional and arranged our dinner reservations, looked after mailing our parcels, arranged great baseball tickets for us; took us to the L-train and showed us how to use it (we're not from Chicago). Hotel rooms were very spacious - we had 2 bedroom suite with balconies and 2.5 baths, & 2 living/sitting rooms. Great for 2 couples to share and still have together space/time, and private time/space. 2 issues: Maid came to our door every morning at 9am, and every morning we turned her away -- rather irritating on a holiday. And 1 balcony was dirty with old food during our entire stay - even after mentioning to maid. Expensive so these 2 irritants count against value. Otherwise, near perfection.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Bradford Mann","date":"2013-08-26 11:25:57 +0300"},{"content":"I stayed at the Elysian for 1 night at I was blown away by the quality and service of this hotel.

We booked the hotel based on feedback from trip advisor and you were all right it was amazing. We have stayed in hotels all around the world and this is one of the best nothing is too much trouble and all of the staff have to be commended. We stayed in a suite and the room was spacious and well equipped I particularly loved the giant tub which i spent many a happy hour in there. We had all never been to Chicago but will go back for nothing else but the Elysian. The hotel has a level of class that outshines the larger 5 star hotels but also tries to make you feel welcome and at home at all times. Go you will not be sorry.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Casandra Glover DVM","date":"2013-03-15 11:59:17 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed 3 nights in this beautiful hotel, and thoroughly enjoyed their top quality service from check-in to departure.

The Elysian produced an experience BEYOND compare. The facilities are incomparable. But the staff really makes The Elysian as amazing as it is. My experience was \"made\" because of their hard work. It's not easy to staff an entire hotel with *happy* employees who love what they do and are willing to go the extra mile to make each person's experience a perfect one. Kudos to you all! And, as far as the review goes-- you have to see it to believe it. All that you read is true-- TVs in the bathroom mirror, plunge tub, terraces, fireplaces. I had my first single diner experience at 2* RIA. The food, staff, everything was fantastic. Again, entirely congruous with the hotel's standards and philosophy.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Jimmy Schmidt DDS","date":"2013-11-02 22:42:29 +0300"},{"content":"My husband and I stayed here for the very first time on our wedding weekend in July of 2010. Our stay was so luxurious and amazing that we will be back again and again to celebrate anything and everything we can make an excuse for (even though we live in the Chicago area). We were already back again in March to celebrate hubby's birthday, and received a special birthday treat from the pastry chef (I didn't even ask for it)! Small gestures such as these, full of kindness and attention to detail, will keep us coming back to the Elysian for years to come.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Noemi Marquardt","date":"2014-11-10 06:56:25 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Dr. Lavonne Mante","Chase Jakubowski","Shanny Runte"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Five star luxury hotel in a Modernist tower across the road from Harvey Nichols, with views over Knightsbridge and Hyde Park.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
