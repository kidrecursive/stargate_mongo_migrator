The third Earl of Burlington (1694-1753), who designed this elegant Classical villa close to the Thames, drew inspiration from his ''grand tours'' of Italy, while William Kent was employed to create sumptuous interiors to contrast with the pure exterior. The Neo-Classical gardens, although much reduced from their original size, are the perfect complement to the house.","geo":{"lat":51.483279,"lon":-0.2587,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16466,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null}
