I found the bed rather firm, and the bathroom walls are in need of a good clean or re-paint (splashes, scrapes and writing on the wall under the hairdryer). There is a good choice of TV channels, the room was quiet, and they have replaced the silly mini-fridges that were there on my last stay with small bar fridges which actually keep things cold. Housekeeping staff are friendly and were prompt in servicing the room. My main problem was the slow WIFI Internet. I was able to work online very early in the morning (from 4am to 5.30am), but at all other times it was so slow I just gave up. Don't think I will stay again.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Brannon Weissnat","date":"2013-12-18 22:36:14 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed here as part of our 3 month world tour and were not disappointed.

Room is really clean and bright and no strange smell even though the restroom is totally not \"open-to-the-air\". staffs there are polite and attentive. Also, the location is good. Subway is around 500m away and the bus stop just in front of the hotel. Overall. It is a nice hotel and if you get the deal, it become really great. Oh, BTW, they got really nice bed for sleep.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Delores Konopelski","date":"2014-05-31 16:56:54 +0300"},{"content":"Rooms a bit small, but nice decor.

Designed for business travellers, but with some adaptation (i.e.sleeping bag) we could squeeze a family of 3 in their room. That is the only complain I had - wish there was a little more space in the room, to put an extra bed. Breakfast was excellent - enjoyed it much. Location is good - walking distance to Orchard street, MRT. Health faucets by commode could be a good addition to the minimalistic-yet-functional bathroom.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Emelia Lesch MD","date":"2012-01-23 23:28:57 +0300"},{"content":"hotel located well, very clean but very small rooms (ok for 2-3 nights.
