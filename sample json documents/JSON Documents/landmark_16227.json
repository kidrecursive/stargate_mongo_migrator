A small but historic and award-winning pub; it dates to 1586 and marked the boundary between the gardens of Christopher Hatton and the Bishop of Ely. Parts of the Tudor pub remain, although it was rebuilt in 1757 and partially altered in 1781 and 1930; now a Grade II listed building. It's tied to Fuller's brewery, so it has their usual range plus a few unusual guests. Only open one weekend in the year, to coincide with CAMRA's Great British Beer Festival in August.","geo":{"lat":51.5183,"lon":-0.1074,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":16227,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Ye_Olde_Mitre_Tavern_-_geograph.org.uk_-_763877.jpg"}
