From the top, you have a spectacular 360Â° view of Yosemite Valley (including Yosemite, Vernal, and Nevada Falls) and parts of the high country. A loop including Taft Point is a nice addition, but the climb from Taft Point to the top of the dome goes up several hundred feet.","geo":{"lat":37.7122148374,"lon":-119.586492571,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":33877,"country":"United States","city":"Mariposa County","state":"California"}
