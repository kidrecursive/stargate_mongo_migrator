Still an active parish, it is in the middle of downtown on Chorro St and Monterey St, with its main courtyard interrupting Monterey St for a full city block. In addition to the church, there is a small museum; both are definitely worth visiting. The Mission is part of the '''Mission Plaza''' development, which incorporates San Luis Creek and a number of stores and restaurants.  Walk from the Mission to the creek and up to one of the restaurants for a bite to eat.","geo":{"lat":35.280791,"lon":-120.664065,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":26283,"country":"United States","city":"San Luis Obispo","state":"California"}
