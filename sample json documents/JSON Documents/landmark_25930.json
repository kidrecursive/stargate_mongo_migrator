The best time to see and photograph the winding street from the bottom (from Leavenworth St) is in the morning because Lombard Street runs east-west and slopes eastward. The best time to see and photograph the view from the top (from Hyde St) is in the afternoon. At night there are great views of Telegraph Hill and Coit Tower. The wild parrots of Telegraph Hill frequently fly over head in the morning.","geo":{"lat":37.8021,"lon":-122.4188,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25930,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
