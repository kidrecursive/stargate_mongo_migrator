{"title":"Edinburgh/West","name":"Cramond","alt":null,"address":null,"directions":"Catch the No. 41 bus to this pretty seaside village (now absorbed into the city)","phone":null,"tollfree":null,"email":null,"url":null,"hours":null,"image":null,"price":null,"content":"Archeological evidence suggests that Cramond is actually older than Edinburgh itself, having been inhabited since around 8500BC. Its location where the River Almond flows into the Firth of Forth meant it was strategically important, and the Romans had a fort here, the remains of which can still be seen. There are several options for waterside walking, with a path along the wooded Almond riverbank to the south, a seafront promenade along the Forth to the east, and a causeway across the Firth of Forth to '''Cramond Island''' (check the noticeboard re: tide times before crossing!). It used to be possible to walk to the west across the Dalmeny Estate towards [[South Queensferry]], but the ferry across the River Almond stopped running when the boatman found a Roman statue of a lioness buried in the muddy riverbed, and retired on the monetary reward (you can see the impressive statue in the National Museum of Scotland). Once you've done walking around admiring the sights, enjoy a well-earned refreshment in the welcoming ''Cramond Inn'' or ''Cramond Tearooms''.","geo":{"lat":55.9803,"lon":-3.3003,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":8700,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Edinburgh","state":null}
