They have retained the historic quality while updating the hotel so the common areas (lobby, restaurants, and meeting space) are really nice. For a business traveler with all expenses covered, it is a great hotel. For anyone else, it is rather expensive even beyond the room rate and Boston taxes that apply to all the hotels in this area. The Park Plaza basically has no parking so you must use valet parking that was $44 a night (plus tips), which seemed very high even by Boston standards. Web access was over $10 a day, and it was unreliable. The bars and restaurants were expensive compared to other places in the neighborhood so leave the hotel to eat. I would generally not recommend it for families as the historic hotel rooms and especially the bathrooms are too small for more than one or two people. There is also no pool.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":1.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Ashtyn Hansen","date":"2014-12-07 23:36:09 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Ken Christiansen II","Nellie Raynor","Joshua Lueilwitz I","Marianna Gleason Jr.","Florida Howell","Jake Abernathy","Madie Littel","Mr. Adriel McKenzie"],"vacancy":false,"description":"accommodation and food","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":false,"free_parking":false}
