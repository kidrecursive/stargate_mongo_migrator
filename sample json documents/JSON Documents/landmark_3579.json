Though they do have plates, ask to keep your bowls and chopsticks for a more authentic experience. Try the hot Chinese tea, the spring rolls (with spicy dipping sauce) or the vegetarian lettuce wrapped to start, the side of Shangri-la noodles (fried, dry with various meats), and the sizzling steak (in strips, with sauce and vegetables). It will be ample for two.","geo":{"lat":52.4766,"lon":-1.89889,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":3579,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Birmingham","state":null}
