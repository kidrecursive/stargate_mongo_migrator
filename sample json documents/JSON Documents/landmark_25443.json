The place is tiny (the open grill is right behind the cash-register), the decor dated, and the three Vietnamese ladies who run it are about as friendly as a poke in the eye, but the food is excellent, fresh, well seasoned, and very cheap.  The crab soup is a favorite as is the inimitable $3.50 pork sandwich.","geo":{"lat":37.798,"lon":-122.4075,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":25443,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
