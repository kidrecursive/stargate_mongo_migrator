We were suprised by the space of the apartments. you get a fully equiped kitchen.THE 2 bedrooms were of good size wthe comfy beds. in the master the jaccuzi bath was great along with the walkin shower. fabulous. The hotel staff were pleasent. the only downside is the sun doesnt go over the pool area.( But the pool was heated to perfection and the hot tub was great. Kids loved the pool. We stayed on the 8th floor and the view was lovely. when we visit Florida again we will defo stay at Lake Eve.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Mr. Ericka Stehr","date":"2015-08-31 10:05:28 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Maxie Sporer","Alexandrine Quitzon","Andre Upton","Enid Brakus","Luis Homenick","Nikolas Toy","Warren Harvey","Autumn Quigley"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Luxury hotel property with a spa. Western themed, but don't let that square you - the decor is modern and classy with all the touches of a (fancy) home. Lovely gardens, many types of rooms, and free internet. Breakfast and wine reception included. MacArthur also has free DVDs you can borrow and a fitness center. Onsite restaurant is Saddles, a high end steakhouse with a tacky cowboy theme.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":false,"free_parking":false}
