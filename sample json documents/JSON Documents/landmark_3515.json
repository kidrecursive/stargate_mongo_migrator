It is also a symbol of modernisation of Birmingham, as it was originally built to house the Central Telephone Exchange for Birmingham, and the logos of the Bell-Edison company are still visible within the building. As the telephone exchange relocated many decades ago, the building now houses office and a bar.","geo":{"lat":52.48151,"lon":-1.90163,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":3515,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Birmingham","state":null}
