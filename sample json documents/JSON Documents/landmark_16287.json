It was moved to Waterloo and then to its present position on the bridge.  Keen students of biology may notice that the statue is missing certain male body parts.  It was originally anatomically correct but was deemed too lewd and scandalous when placed closer to pedestrians' eye-level and was castrated so as not to cause offence. | image=Redlion.jpg","geo":{"lat":51.5009,"lon":-0.1199,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16287,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Redlion.jpg"}
