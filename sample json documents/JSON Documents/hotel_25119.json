As my husband had never been to Seattle, we picked the Four Seasons for its proxemity to the waterfront and Pike's Market. The rooms were beautiful. We enjoyed the large soaking tub, the ability to watch the news in the mirror while getting dressed in the morning, and the view of the water. Just like all Four Seasons stays, this one was fantastic. The only negative could happen anywhere...I left my jewelry pouch on the made bed. It had several irreplaceable items int it. I called within 45 minutes of checking out but they didn't have any of their staff members report it.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Daphne Hettinger","date":"2013-07-27 17:27:16 +0300"},{"content":"We were warmly greeted at check-in and that warmth was maintained throughout our three night stay. Upon check-in we we received a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe bay view room and thoroughly enjoyed watching the ferries and cruise ships come and go and getting a glimpse of the Olympic Mountains beyond Elliot Bay. In addition, we were treated to a bottle of sparkling wine and chocolate covered strawberries as an anniversary was being celebrated during our stay. We ate our breakfast at ART and everthing was delicious, especially the lemon ricotta pancakes. The location was convenient to everything. We walked through Pike Place Market and to Safeco Field for a Mariner's game. We aren't big shoppers but the shopping core was within a few blocks. If we ever need to stay in a hotel in Seattle again,we would definitely stay at the Four Seasons.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Jacynthe Waelchi","date":"2012-03-14 22:50:01 +0300"},{"content":"Warm, personable, intelligent and competent staff from the doorman to the concierge to the management.

The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance or short drive to shopping, Pike place market, and lots of good eats. Staff was friendly, professional and attentive to our every need. Our tastefully decorated and spacious room had two queen beds, a lounge chair with ottoman, table, awesome bathroom, and large windows to soak up the gorgeous bay view. We enjoyed the infinity pool and hot tub which had the same amazing view.
