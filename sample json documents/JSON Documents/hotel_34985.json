The choice of the Intercontinental-San Juan was the best. The location is just 2 miles from the airport. Our room, which we upgraded to Ambassador level, put us oceanfront which had a magnificent view & included a sofabed & large club chair. The bathroom was a little small, but the extra vanity by the closet was helpful. The staff at the pool & beach area were very helpful. For travelers with children there are nearby chain restaurants: Chili's, Burger King, Ponderosa. A large grocery store 3 blocks was great to buy snacks & bottled water, cheese & crackers, yogurt, which we could keep in the fridge in our room. The taxi service in Puerto Rico is quick & clean. There is a public transportation stop just outside the hotel for sight-seeing such as Old SanJuan for $.75, but allow about 40 minutes each way. The best part of the trip was the ocean & pool areas & having our 4 p.m. pina coladas under our umbrella ($10. daily rental). Go & enjoy this great spot.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Clementina Abernathy","date":"2015-03-04 12:21:45 +0300"},{"content":"Booked 4 nights at the IC Hotel in January using priority club points. The stay was the absolute WORST IC hotel experience ever. I am a Royal Ambassador and was treated terrible by hotel management from check in to checkout. Hotel staff, especially Guest Relations and Front Desk Manager, was extremely rude when I questioned them on upgrading to a better (Platinum Royal Ambassador. Was told 3 different stories why I could not get upgraded to the Club floor or junior suite (standard practices at all other IC Hotels for Platinum Royal Ambassador Members). In addition to my experience with hotel management, the common hallways were very dirty and stayed that way for 2 of the 4 days. Rooms are very small and noisy. Would not recommend this hotel at all. I did not use hotel restaurants or bars in protest of check in experience. I do however recommend the restaurant and lounges at the El San Juan Hotel next door to IC which are extremely nice. Did use the IC spa and was cheated out of 15 minutes of paid spa time. When I complained to Spa manager her English went away. Relayed story to Front Desk Manager, who said he would look into the problem but never did. The last 2 years I have stayed on average 90 nights at priority club properties all over the world. This stay alone has encouraged me to seek out a new hotel group that treats all guest staying at their property (paid and reward nights) the same. If I am treated this way as a platinum royal ambassador, I canâ€™t image how other guest would be treated. Hotel appears to be more interested in entertaining the local population with their small casino than hotel guests.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Reed Gleichner","date":"2012-12-25 07:05:10 +0300"},{"content":"My partner & I stayed here for 5 nights in early February after spending 3 nights at El Convento in Old San Juan (see separate review for that). Although I had done my research and expected the Intercontinental to be nice, the hotel really blew us away and exceeded our expectations in almost every way. First off, we got a great deal that included a free night and full breakfast every day. The breakfast buffet costs $25 per person so this was a great thing to have included. On top of that, we were upgraded for free to on ocean view room on the 7th floor when we checked in (we had booked and payed for a pool/garden view). Service was outstanding everywhere, from the door men to the car rental desk. The property is gorgeous and they are on a very nice, but busy, piece of beach. Like all of San Juan, drinks & food are expensive here. Although we didnâ€™t eat dinner at the hotel, we did have cocktails and lunches quite often at the beach bar restaurant. The hotel even has a wine bar which was very nice as well. As several other reviewers have mentioned, Isla Verde is not the place to stay if youâ€™re looking to visit OSJ which is why we split our 8 night trip between 2 different places. We rented a car one day and drove to El Yunque and a visit to Luquillo Beach. Although there was a lot of traffic, it was nice to be on our own schedule and it was also less expensive than going on an organized tour. Make sure to visit Nestor, the concierge, who was so helpful arranging or recommending anything. We did the spa one day and the facilities were very nice. There are several great restaurants close by; we actually ate better here than we did in OSJ which, again, surprised me. The best dinner we had our entire trip was at Pamelaâ€™s in Ocean Park, about a 15 minute drive from the hotel. Cheâ€™s, an Argentinean steak house, was also awesome and about a 5-10 drive or cab ride from the hotel. Within walking distance is Metropol for really great Cuban food. For the most part, we enjoyed the sun & sand here and basically relaxed in style which is exactly what we wanted. Highly recommended.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Kristopher Crona","date":"2013-10-16 19:13:31 +0300"},{"content":"Interesting as always to separate fact and fiction from the reviews on the site. Facts. The safe was locked when I got in the room and may have been broken, but I did not care and nothing was stolen. The pool is not heated, but it was over eighty and the water felt good after laying in the sun. There is seaweed in the ocean and last I checked that happens in the ocean. If you wade out about ten feet it was clear. The rooms are not huge but they are not small ala a w hotel. The staff was great, very friendly and helpful. The breakfast staff was exceptional at the buffet. Food at the pool and hotel was reasonable for a resort. Not cheap but not bahama expensive either. They do charge the resort fee as they indicated on the site when booking so no surprise there. Overall great hotel resort, easily walkover to el San Juan to see the crowds. As for improvements. New beach chairs would be nice as would fresh paint on the balconies and better reception on the television. Still all told my kids wanted to plan on going back next year.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Riley Kunze","date":"2015-04-18 08:14:50 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed at this hotel two days before a cruise and one night afterwards. The rooms were very spacious and had two queen sized comfortable beds. The staff were attentive and most friendly and willing to assist. The breakfast was fantastic, with a vast choice of everything you could wish for. The chef who does the eggs and omletts sings and dances as he cooks, he was my favourite. The hotel is in close proximity to the airport and there are many restaurants and shops in walking distance. The beach is clean and not at all crowded, there are some stalls but no one hastles you to buy. The gym is open 24 hours which is handy when you body is adjusting to the time difference. I loved Puerto Rico and plan to come back for a longer period of thime.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Kattie Deckow","date":"2014-07-09 19:32:14 +0300"},{"content":"After the initial surprise and worry of how close to the airport the hotel is, we were very pleased with this hotel. The room was nicely sized, and although our 7th floor ocean front faced a tree, we could see ocean to the right and left of the tree. It also looked over some ugly rooftops of buildings, and the balcony had only room to stand. Other than that, the hotel was just great. The pool was wonderfully large, with one bar in the pool and one on the ocean. The restaurants inside the hotel were rather expensive, but there are plenty of choices around the hotel. Take a couple of trips into Old San Juan, one in the day and one at night. At first we didn't think we would enjoy another trip to San Juan, but after a week, those thoughts were quickly banished.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Emory Abshire","date":"2014-07-28 16:21:47 +0300"},{"content":"Extremely courteous and helpful staff.

The staff is friendly, but I noticed not many around. I had to walk to the bar to get a drink. The pool rea and the beach are very nice...the pool should be cleaned every day and its not.
