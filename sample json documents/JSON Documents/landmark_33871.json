The trail provides great views of Half Dome and eastern Yosemite Valley.  Those without the time (or energy) to make it to the top can hike about one mile to the railed-in Columbia Rock, which itself has great views.  In summer, the trail is hot and dusty, so bring lots of water.","geo":{"lat":37.7424707605,"lon":-119.602230713,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":33871,"country":"United States","city":"Mariposa County","state":"California"}
