Food is just mediocre but the beer is adequate and features HopMonk's own beer (if you like Biersch's beers...) and other regional and international brews. Service is often slow and not always the most attentive but a lot of younger &quot;hip&quot; locals hang out here and they have live music most nights of the week.","geo":{"lat":38.288668,"lon":-122.45875,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":27815,"country":"United States","city":"Sonoma","state":"California"}
