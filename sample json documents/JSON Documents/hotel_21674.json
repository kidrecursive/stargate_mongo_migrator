We arrived around 11pm and were greeted with a friendly smile. Our room was clean and looked to recently updated. The bed was very comfortable and the square pillow we perfect. Our Lanai gave us a view of the Banyan Tree, harbor and the west mountains. Upon arrival we also received a parking pass that allowed us to park in a lot about 100 yards from the hotel which saved us at least $20 a day. They have a nice courtyard and the onsite restaurant was very good as well.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Roma Wolff","date":"2013-06-16 17:39:17 +0300"},{"content":"Charming older hotel right in the Lahaina shopping loop and directly in front of the pier.

Since I was going to Maui on my latest trip alone I decided to be a bit more economical and stayed at the Pioneer Inn. I'd noticed it on previous visits and a co-worker who had stayed here recommended it. The rates are comparatively very good and the location is great since I'm a big fan of Lahaina. I stayed here for 5 nights in Sept. '06 when I was on Maui for the marathon weekend races. The race starts were just a short drive up the coast...maybe 10 mins. tops which wasn't a problem at all. Not having a beach right outside my door wasn't a problem either in my case especially since I love putting the windows down on my rental car and turning up some local tunes on the radio and enjoying the drive. I went to several different spectacular beaches all up and down the coast which I think is the best way to see Maui anyway. I'd do this even if I were at one of the higher end resorts. While at the Pioneer Inn I really enjoyed getting up for sunrise in the mornings and sitting on the seawall which was right outside my door and watching Lanai light up as the sun hit it. I also enjoyed watching the local kids surfing right in front of the hotel before they went off to school in the mornings and again in the evenings. I liked the idea that the locals seemed to congregate at a small park right outside the hotel by the seawall. This spot is one of the most relaxing I have ever experienced. I enjoyed walking the streets of Lahaina in the evenings also and meeting some of the local characters...and they have their share...and you will meet them unless you make an effort not to. All of this was right there surrounding the hotel, so I loved it. As for the hotel itself, being a history fan, I enjoyed the character of the place and the old feel of it. My room was fairly large and clean if not overly plush. It's not the Westin or the Grand Wailea, but it is perfectly functional and I didn't spend much time there anyway other than to sleep. The balcony was a bit public, but that was charming to me. My room overlooked the banyan tree and I actually enjoyed hearing the birds when I sat outside. I wasn't bothered by them at all when the door was closed and I was sleeping. The a/c in my room was fine and not loud at all as a previous reviewer noted. I liked the interior window shutters that actually worked rather than being for decoration. They do help keep out the noise and light also. The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating. I had breakfast twice in the hotel restaurant and it was very good. I recommend it. Sitting out on the lanai watching the town come alive in the morning was very nice. Parking was a couple of blocks away which you may want to know ahead of time, but it was free and walking through the streets of Lahaina is fun anyway. Had a great visit and plan to return this September. I'd recommend it to anyone not determined to stay at a luxurious resort on a beach. Those places are great too, but for a relaxed low key vacation this place is it.","ratings":{"Overall":4.0},"author":"Thelma Bauch","date":"2012-11-11 08:29:49 +0300"},{"content":"The oldest hotel in town, the Pioneer Inn, is a local landmark. Itâ€™s smack in the middle of Lahaina. I stayed there with my wife and 3 boys (ages 11, 9, and 5). Itâ€™s not a place I would want to spend a week at, but for a night or two it has a great location while capturing the feel of Lahaina and its kooky, touristy fun. The Pioneer Inn was built in 1901 and was the only hotel in western Maui until 1964. Itâ€™s now under the Best Western banner. There is a plaque at the registration desk citing them as one of the top Best Westerns in the country. Iâ€™m not surprisedâ€¦it was definitely the best Best Western I have ever stayed at. They had a set of rules posted by the desk from when the hotel first opened. Some of them are pretty funny such as â€œIf you burn or wet you bed, you going outâ€� and â€œYou are not allow in the down stears in the seating room or in the dinering room or in the kitchen when you are drunk.â€�. Fortunately, the boys remained sober and enjoyed climbing the banyan tree next door for nearly an hour. We had a great lunch at Aloha Mixed Plate and the boys satisfied their pizza jones at B.J.â€™s that night. You will not lack for dining choices in Lahaina. Our room was a â€œsuiteâ€�, although there was no separate sitting room. It was very spacious, however. We had a king bed and a queen pull-down Murphy bed. The hotel also has pretty decent and FREE wireless high-speed Internet access. There was a small lanai that overlooks an inner courtyard. You have no privacy on the lanaiâ€”itâ€™s more a motel-like internal open hallway with the lanais separated by open wooden fences. Our room overlooking the garden was very peaceful, however. A number of rooms overlook the main drag, Front Street. I would imagine they could be pretty noisy and/or excellent vantage points for first-class people watching, depending on your mood. The room was very clean and everything was in working order. Reception staff was gracious and friendly. All-in-all, this is no fancy resort, but is a very good value. I would definitely stay again. The morning we checked out we had excellent, plate-covering macadamia nut pancakes in the hotelâ€™s restaurant. A nice cap to a nice stay. When youâ€™re in Lahaina you look at the pretty green clapboard siding of the Pioneer Inn with its white trim and you say to yourself, â€œgee, I wish I could stay in a place like thatâ€�. Well, you can.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Rowena Ledner","date":"2014-06-08 09:15:33 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Blair Hudson","Ms. Kathryne Waelchi"],"vacancy":false,"description":"A typical Novotel in a faraway corner of the 17th, not really close to anything nor particularly conveniently located.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
