They have cheap prices, a pool table and a couple seats by the door for the smokers. Nice mix of locals and tourists, very low key and down to earth. A very good place to make new friends and gets a good young crowd after about nine.","geo":{"lat":37.8039,"lon":-122.4151,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":25488,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
