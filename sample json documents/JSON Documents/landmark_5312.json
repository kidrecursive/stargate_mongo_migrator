A short walk will allow you to see the other side of the mountain towards St. Gervais, Sallanches and the glacier de Bionnassay.  In August 2005, a round-trip pedestrian adult ticket was €12.10. Another option is to take the '''Montblanc Tramway''' from St.Gervais Le Fayet that goes up to Nid d'aigle. It stops at Bellevue on the way. There are beautiful views over the valley from Nid d'Aigle also.","geo":{"lat":45.8896,"lon":6.7889,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":5312,"country":"France","city":"Les Houches","state":"Rhône-Alpes"}
