Significant as the last work of Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, also responsible for Waterloo Bridge, Battersea Power Station, Liverpool Cathedral and even the red telephone box. He continued to work on the plans for the church even when hospitalised for lung cancer, and did so until his death. Today the church is well attended by young students and is worth taking note of on your way down to the Hoe.","geo":{"lat":50.3699444,"lon":-4.142124,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":22556,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Plymouth","state":null}
