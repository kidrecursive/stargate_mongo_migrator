Their fans are famous the world over for the unique atmosphere they create at Anfield and the singing of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' on matchdays. They have a very heated rivalry with Manchester United FC, considered by most football fans to be the biggest rivalry in all of England; a rivalry which stems from the traditional city rivalry between Manchester and Liverpool since the Industrial Revolution, and further fueled by the fact that both clubs are the most successful English clubs in European and domestic competition. Matches between the two sides are always very charged affairs which attract sell-out crowds. Crowd violence is rare though, as there is always a strong police presence at big matches to keep things in order.","geo":{"lat":53.431405,"lon":-2.959987,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":15864,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Liverpool","state":null}
