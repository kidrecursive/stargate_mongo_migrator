It features pages of every type of pancake you can imagine, which also happen to be twice as large as any pancake you've ever had, and still manage to be fluffy-thick and light on the tummy. Coffee is fresh, in a French press, and the menu features more than just breakfast. Short story: Food is awesome, service is great, but its always crowded. Don't worry though, they serve fast and you will feel the wait is worth it.","geo":{"lat":34.097866,"lon":-118.36221,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":11772,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
