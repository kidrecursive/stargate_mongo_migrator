The only reason we didn't check out and go somewhere else was that everywhere else was booked out! Long story short they over booked the hotel and kept us waiting for 5 hours for our room! When we did eventually get in, the room stunk of cigarette smoke, was dirty, the toilet leaked and the staff were useless. I would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone. It completely ruined our Istanbul experience. The good things about this hotel include the breakfast and the location.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Tyrell Lesch","date":"2012-05-21 02:02:48 +0300"}],"public_likes":[],"vacancy":false,"description":"A reasonably-priced boutique hotel with decorations that feature international travel.
