The sushi is reasonably good and not outrageously priced, but the love-it-or-hate-it feature of this restaurant is the numerous screens scattered around the eating area showing everything from sports to 1950's surfer flicks. For some this provides a unique atmosphere, while those with attention deficit issues may not be able to focus on just one thing for days afterward.","geo":{"lat":33.98851,"lon":-118.47034,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":32161,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
