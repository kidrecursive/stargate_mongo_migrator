It's the only Renaissance Hotel restaurant in the country that sustains itself without support from the hotel. Steaks, seafood, pasta and seasonal dishes with a great wine list available. The bar, where they serve a cheaper bar menu with wood-fired pizzas, is popular with locals and tourists alike. They also have an outdoor patio but the view isn't much to mention.","geo":{"lat":38.27742,"lon":-122.46047,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":27801,"country":"United States","city":"Sonoma","state":"California"}
