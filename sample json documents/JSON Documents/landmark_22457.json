This loch was named Loch Faskally and is approximately 5 kilometres long. The dam is home to the famous Pitlochry salmon ladder which provides a route for the salmon to make their way upstream along the River Tummel, beyond the dam itself. The dam is also significant for its contribution to the post-WW2 development of hydro-electric power which brought electricity to the Highlands.","geo":{"lat":56.69878,"lon":-3.73935,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":22457,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Perth and Kinross","state":null}
