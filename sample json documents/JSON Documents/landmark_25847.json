Written up in 'W' and 'Newsweek' magazines for the best martinis in the US back in the 80s. Drinks are moderately expensive but of exceptional quality, even from the well.  An intimate and classy setting for a romantic evening with a juke box that leans toward swing and big band music. Named for the Well of Zamzam, one of the holiest places in Islam, a source of blessed beverages.","geo":{"lat":37.7695,"lon":-122.4493,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":25847,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
