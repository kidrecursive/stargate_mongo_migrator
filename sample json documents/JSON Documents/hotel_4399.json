Because of Trip Advisor, I chose Harvest Inn in St Helena. What a wonderful place. The meeting was very successful; the staff made me a hero with my boss. This is a small boutique hotel with a wonderful conference center. We had the rooms that surrounded the Conference Center, which has a huge terrace. We owned this space, attendees did not get lost; everyone was on time for meetings. The hotel does not have a restaurant, however the caterers that the hotels use are incredible. We had casual dining and a formal awards banquet. The hotel did not miss a beat. The grounds are beautiful and well-manicured. Floral is in bloom everywhere you look. The hotel also overlooks a working vineyard. You truly know you are in wine country. While we were there a wedding was taking place overlooking the vineyard; what a beautiful and romantic place for a wedding. All of the major wineries are very nearby; the concierge was very helpful with planning an additional wine tour and transportation for 30 people. This is a must do for all small groups and for romantic get-a-ways. I canâ€™t wait to return with my husband.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Lexus Olson","date":"2014-01-11 02:46:24 +0300"},{"content":"This was the most beautiful hotel that I have ever been to.
