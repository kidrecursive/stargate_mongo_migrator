Traditional pub popular with New Town locals, students, the suits from local offices, pretty much everyone in fact. Gets very busy in summer due to its lovely beer garden - one of the few pubs close to the city centre to have one. Plenty of drink options and they also do decent food. Perhaps slightly more expensive than most places on Broughton Street but cheaper than George Street.","geo":{"lat":55.95895,"lon":-3.19712,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":8609,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Edinburgh","state":null}
