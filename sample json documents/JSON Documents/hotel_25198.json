The location was great -- 1 block north of the lightrail station, which allows for a quick bus ride to the airport and a 15 minute ride to downtown. We got a great rate especially considering the fact that this was during the holidays, and the staff was very friendly. I have had better breakfasts at other properties, but since it is free, it's hard to complain. Note that breakfast closes relatively early since I think the property caters to businessmen, so make sure you don't miss out. Unfortunately, the pool wasn't heated well (or at all) so the ocean-like temperature wasn't particularly enjoyable. Overall, we had a great stay and would consider returning to this hotel if back in the area.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Chadd Zboncak","date":"2013-09-28 02:08:28 +0300"}],"public_likes":[],"vacancy":false,"description":"Bluff-top Hilton hotel overlooking the famous Torrey Pines golf course.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":false,"free_parking":false}
