We were in a large suite and it was wonderful - the best bed and linen I have experienced in a hotel in a long time! I was travelling for work with my boyfriend and we both loved it. We had a rental car so the location didn't matter much and loved the MExican restaurant just down the road. We would definitely stay there again.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Hunter Kessler","date":"2015-05-02 22:49:03 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Jaleel Orn","Miss Princess Cartwright","Murphy Kreiger","Tyra Powlowski","Monica Borer"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Hostel/backpacker style accommodation. 200 beds, clean, safe, plenty of activities.
