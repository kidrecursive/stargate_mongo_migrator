The rooms were spotless and although the beds were a little on the hard side we both found them comfortable enough. The staff were extremely pleasant and attentive and couldn't do enough for the guests and there were people everywhere during the day making sure that the grounds and buildings were maintained to the highest standards. We got reservations in all the a la carte restaurants and particularly enjoyed the Japenese ( we managed to get in there 3 times!!) and the Mexican ( twice) although they were all very nice. I just hope Wilma hasn't damaged any of the hotel and grounds and that the people we left there managed to get home safely. Can't decide where to go next year now as this would be a very difficult place to beat.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Mrs. Araceli Wisoky","date":"2012-11-10 11:03:13 +0300"}],"public_likes":[],"vacancy":false,"description":"Accommodation in lodge at rear of the Inn.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
