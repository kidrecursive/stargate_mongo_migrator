Much original interior detailing survives, including wall panelling, door joinery and finely-detailed surrounds, ornamental plasterwork, hearths and hearth surrounds, together with screens to all the principal bar areas. This consciously-detailed railway hotel  was built at the height of Nelson's rapid industrial development and deliberately designed to impress those arriving in Nelson by rail. Probably the biggest public house in the neighbourhood and now a Freehouse.","geo":{"lat":53.8354,"lon":-2.2148,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":36153,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Nelson","state":null}
