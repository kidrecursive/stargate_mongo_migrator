In 1941, the U.S. Navy ordered the Old Globe to remove equipment and records for a period of 24 hours -- the Navy had acquired Balboa Park for use during World War II. By the summer of 1947, the federal government returned the park to the City of San Diego. In 1978 the theatre was destroyed by fire; a rebuilt theatre opened in 1982.  The area hosts three stages including the Old Globe itself, the Cassius Carter Centre Stage, and an outdoor Lowell Davies Festival Theater.  You will usually have to purchase tickets in advance.","geo":{"lat":32.73216,"lon":-117.15234,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":25098,"country":"United States","city":"San Diego","state":"California"}
