Though the bar is wallpapered with &quot;No Smoking&quot; signs (as California law demands), you need only loiter outside the bar for a few minutes with a cigarette before you are beckoned inside and offered an ashtray. In fact, Hanaro's great charm is it that it's accommodating in every respect; stay for a bit and you will be offered various bar snacks, and there is usually a hostess on hand whose only job is to chat with the patrons. This is done, however, with taste and tact; if you wish to drink in silence, you won't be disturbed. The jukebox is stocked with Asian pop singles.","geo":{"lat":37.7859,"lon":-122.4187,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":25569,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
