First of all, its location is great. Walking onto the balcony and the ocean and Molokini is right in your sight. The famous Big Beach is only minutes drive away. The facility is very carefully maintained. We saw people polishing the door knobs and stair rails every day. The garden inside the hotel is just stunning. The hotel is also big, very big. It can be good or bad depending on peopleâ€™s taste. But we find it very interesting because there is a lot to explore. The room we had was a deluxe ocean view room. It is very clean and has all the amenities you can think of. We have nothing to complain about the staff. They are very helpful and very knowledgeable about what to do and where to go on Maui. The food in the resort is expensive. Thatâ€™s about the only drawback I can think of.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Adan DuBuque","date":"2012-04-21 16:00:38 +0300"},{"content":"This Resort was totally Posh! I cannot understand the negative reviews. Yes, the restaurants are expensive. Yes, they do charge a lot of money. Have you people looked around though? Everything on Maui is expensive, especially the hotels. Every hotel charges about double for drinks. If you go to a restaurant and bar off hotel premises, you will find it a lot cheaper. It is not just the Grand Weilea that charges extra for everything. We stayed at two Hotels on our stay, one which was less stars than the other, and both were comparable when it came to restaurant food and drink. My wife and I are middle class, and we stayed at this resort for 5 days. When we got to the resort, we checked ourselves in and parked our own car to save a little money. We parked our own car everyday, because they charge you money per day to use valet. When we were checked in, we were given a choice for an upgrade, either a king bed or two queens with an ocean view. We chose the ocean view, and what a spectacular view it was. Very Nice! We were very Pleased! The Parking lot is further away if you park yourself, but it was worth a few dollars saved. All resorts charge extra for their daily resort fee, and this is extra in addition to your trip fee, whether it is expedia, unitedvacations, or whatever, so expect it when you go. The Service: Excellent As said above, all you had to do was ask, and you were accomodated. We did not like the puffy pillows in the rooms, so we asked for flatter pillows in our room from housekeeping, and were immediately accomodated. On the beach, staff would help you grab chairs, give you as many towels as you wanted, and it was not too much trouble to ask for anything. Water was free all over the premises. they had tanks w/ cups everywhere. Everyone said hello, or Aloha, or Mahalo. The Room: We were upgraded to Oceanview with two Queens. The view was amazing, and the bathroom came with a two person soaking tub, and a glass enclosed shower, which could easily fit 3 persons if you wanted. Mini bar and frig accompanied the room, and it was very tempting not to use the mini bar, but it was just too expensive. We went to the Weilea village, and were able to buy liqour and beer for less than half the price of the mini bar contents. One should expect the mini bar to be high priced though. There are complimentary robes in the room. the beds are simply plushible comfortability. The Lanai comes with two chairs and a table. The room comes with free internet via internet cable provided. Housekeeping comes twice a day, once in the morning to clean, and once in the evening to provide turn down service. I suggest leaving a couple dollars tip at least, and they will treat you right. Bell men insisted upon helping with the luggage, which we felt was very nice even though we were pretty much doing it ourselves anyway. They also have the Napua Tower, which has its own wing with it's own continental breakfast, and its own Hour d oevers and wine nightly, and also its own concierge. obviously we did not stay here, but passed by it on the way to our room everyday, and wondered about its amenities. it is available for extra dollars of course. The Service: Above Par: Now if you rent one of the cabanas for a cost on the lawn, you will have someone to wait on you and they will bring you frozen grapes all day, but we did not spend the money on the cabana. If you ask the waiter or waitresses for drinks while you are sitting in chairs though, they will gladly accomodate. We did not order too many drinks though because they are really expensive, which we knew going in (12 dollars/mixed drink). If you didn't know this going in, I guess I could see how you could react poorly, but when you go to a resort this size, you should really do a little research. We used chairs on the beach at no cost. Really, the cabanas were not worth the money unless you have a medical condition that prevents you from being in the sun. The Spa: All we heard about when we were at the Resort was how great the Spa was. We did not use it, but apprently it is rated one of the best around. We thought about it several times, but did not want to spend the extra money since we were spending so much already. Beach and Pools: Beach is rated best in the nation many times. I have even seen it on the Travel Channel at Home. Snorkel excursions visit nearby because of all the turtles, and because of it being such a great snorkel site. The beach is pretty much immaculate, with lawn and laying chairs available, nice white sand and fairly calm waters. The pool is in itself just freaking amazing. There are a bunch of pools on a $@!#%, and all are connected by several waterslides, two big ones being the main attractions. Between the two big waterslides is the worlds only water elevator, which takes you to the top of one of the big waterslides. We understood what we paid when we saw and rode in the water elevator. There is an adult habiscus pool which is luke warm rather than the cold water pools near the bottom. There are two adult hot tubs near the adult hibiscus pool, and there is also a massage therapist near the hibiscus pool which is avaiable for a charge. there are probably a total of 5-7 hot tubs, and also several pools. there is a kiddy beach for the kids right off of the regular beach, which is made to be safer, and is really a pool/beach for the children. There are lifeguards all around. The Land: They have about 15 million dollars put into their art work. They have tours of the resort for free just to view their art work if you like that sort of thing. They also have tours for the Flowers and landscape where they explain all that to you if you like that sort of thing also. Eating: We ate and drank very rarely at the hotels we stayed at because it was so expensive. The other hotel we stayed at was the Sheraton. It was also very very nice, and we would go back to either hotel, but the drinking and eating at both places was expensive, so we planned ahead wear to eat and drink by using Maui books bought in different stores. We sprang a little and ate breakfast once at the Grand Weilea in the Grand Dining Room the last morning we were there. My wife is a big breakfast fan, so we tried it. It was $28 pp, and even though it was a huge breakfast, and it included a lot of food, it still was not worth the dollars. That is why we planned ahead to eat off of the resorts. Other: Most people we talked to did not leave the resort, but we knew better. We did the Road to Hana, The Pipwai trail, another hike walk, and viewed many of the beaches North of Kannapali. We also did a Trilogy excurion for our Snorkel trip, and it took us to Molokini, where the water was clear about 50 feet down. We both agreed we had never seen water as clear before, and we have both snorkeled a couple of times before. Trilogy was awesome, fed us breakfast and lunch, and snacks in between, and was always asking us if we needed more to drink. I highly recommend Trilogy! You will need a car on the island if you are going off the resort. It is a negative if you do not get out of your hotel room. If you are not squeemish in the Car, do the Road to Hana, and go to the 7 Sacred Pools, and walk the Pipiwai trail (2 miles one way) Follow the pics and paragraphs in Maui Revealed. It was definitely our little blue book on this trip. Overall: If you go to Maui, I highly recommend that you do you reserach, and plan ahead. Otherwise, you will feel like a lot of others on this site that you were nickel and dimed beyond belief. If you don't expect to spend more than you think, then you will feel like you were shorted. We had an awesome Vacation staying at two hotels that were awesome. We expected to pay more than what we did up front, so expect that from the beginning. Email me for your questions or for pictures. I have a ton of them.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Bradford Bergnaum","date":"2013-03-17 22:12:47 +0300"},{"content":"This hotel is amazing!!
