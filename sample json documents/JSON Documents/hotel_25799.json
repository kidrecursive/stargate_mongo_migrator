Bed was great. Thermostats in room distinguish this from many other NYC hotels. Had fine view of Empire State Bldg and Macy's flagship store. Staff very accommodating. Parking across the street for $30/night w/hotel discount, a good deal for NY.

However, the lack of daily housecleaning services for longer stays is not simply less than luxurious, but frankly results in a room and entire hotel that felt less than clean. From the elevator, to the hallways (including signs and carpets, to most especially the room (and bathroom), the entire facility clearly reflected a lack of attention to detail and a need for daily cleaning. At this price level, and given the way they present themselves, The Inn At St. Botolph fell far short of my expectations.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Dr. Alanna Considine","date":"2015-12-20 05:47:50 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Kyra Balistreri","Roy Upton","Beau Littel III"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Another standard motor inn, this one offers free parking and a complimentary continental breakfast to get you going in the morning.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
