A well run hotel, friendly staff, lovely bedding, perfectly adequate and nice room for the price. We also got a $25 voucher per night's stay to spend on breakfast or bar (we chose the latter generally!). The hotel is just over a 5 minute walk to Dotties True Blue cafe on Jones St., which doesn't look like much but has really great breakfasts, enough to last you until dinner! Free wifi very reliable and a decent speed.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Scot Hirthe","date":"2014-06-28 18:44:00 +0300"},{"content":"A thoroughly helpful bellboy took care of us when we arrived, all jet-lagged and crazy.
