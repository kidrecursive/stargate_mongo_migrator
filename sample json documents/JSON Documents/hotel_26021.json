No does not mean no, it just leads to another 'incredible' offer. Even though they'll spend 45 min on the previous 'incredible' offer. Higher interest rates than the worse credit card, they are 100% ready to throw anyone the anchor that will send them into massive financial problems.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":2.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Kyle Hodkiewicz","date":"2014-04-13 16:06:59 +0300"},{"content":"The staff at reception wouldnt even acknowledge the problem.
