I was with my daughter and two grandchildren 6 and 8 years of age. We were in the Tiziano Apartment. Our stay was lovely and most elegant. The large open living room made us feel that we were royalty. The upstairs bathroom and bedroom were comfortable and attractive. We wanted to own the apartment and never leave. During the sweltering heat we were refreshed when we returned to our apartment by the comfortable air conditioning and delightfully helpful staff. It is living in an historical palace with all of the modern conveniences. My family adored the kitchen and we often planned our day over morning breakfast in our room. There is also a lovely breakfast room if you wish to be served. The location is perfect....away from the maddening crowd, in a very Venetian neighborhood but near a vaporetto and traghetto. We often walked to the Dorsoduro and San Marco and to the Rialto Bridge. It was a pleasure to return to our truly Venetian community at the end of a long sightseeing day. We want to return and stay at the Residence Palazzo Odoni in the immediate future.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Brain Pacocha","date":"2015-05-21 07:22:45 +0300"},{"content":"We had a great time in the romantic city of Venice, and Palazzo Odoni contributed to that. Firstly, the rooms were enormous and the kitchenette was well-stocked. The bathroom was spotless and the jacuzzi bath was a nice treat. The bedroom was comfortable. The members of staff were very friendly. You have to leave your keys with reception on leaving the palazzo and buzz yourself in on your return - this was no problem; we were never left waiting very long outside. One of the best things about this place is the location - it is a short walk from Piazzale Roma which is handy for arriving/leaving. We visited in the winter, but I bet the courtyard is even more beautiful in the summer. I'd love to go back to Venice and would hope that the Palazzo Odoni is available!","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Gustavo McClure","date":"2012-05-13 23:15:09 +0300"},{"content":"We had a very unpleasant stay in Residence Palazzo. At the time of the booking, the owner did not specify that the hotel is divided in two different businesses - a B&B/hotel and the Residence which is apartments. Hence, when we had an issue with the missing baby crib and poorly managed utensil, we reported the issue with the staff at the reception. The staff rudely said that he could not help us with any one of the amenities of the apartment because he looks after the hotel requirements. Later on when we communicated the issue with the owner through e-mail because we did not have any phone in the apartment, and our phones were out of charge, the owner seemed very angry with the idea of sending him an e-mail. He said he would have liked if we have reported the issue when he was around. But we noticed that issue around 7:00 pm in the evening, and he was not around at that time. Later on the next day we went again in the morning to talk to him directly. We could not find him. As soon as we stepped out of the hotel, my son fell down on the streets, and he was bleeding on his mouth. We immediately went back to the apartment to look out for the owner or somebody who can help us with his bleeding. The owner was nowhere to be found. Later on one of the cleaning ladies helped us clean my sonâ€™s bleeding. Later on when we talked to the owner about our issues, he was not at all ready to listen to us, and kept on showing his disappointment with the e-mail. When we told him about our sonâ€™s mishap, he was rude and said we could have gone to pharmacist, which is two blocks from the apartment. He was not all kind, and did not show any empathy. Thanks to that cleaning lady who helped us. However there was no first aid box in the hotel. Also, some of the hotel staff was also kind. One of them helped us carry our luggage down to the apartment door early in the morning. There is no printer the hotel, and nobody provided us any information about the nearby attractions. We had been in so many hotels since the time when we arrived in Europe, and we have been welcomed with the information booklet, and necessary information about the surroundings that we expected the same with Residence Palazzo. But, when we asked, we were told to consult the information center, which is supposed to be close to the hotel. The controls for Jacuzzi in the room were not functioning properly. Once in ten times it used to work. We had been very disappointed with the ownerâ€™s behavior and his negative receptiveness to our concerns, so we did not take pains to report this issue. However, the owner did seem slightly concerned when he in the response of my e-mail, asked me to keep the windows open (in the chilling weather) while cooking to avoid causing any inconvenience to others. But it seemed more of retaliation to my e-mail than a concern for the neighbors. We do appreciate the owner for carrying our luggage up to the apartment when we arrived. We had cancelled our booking in one of the prestigious hotels located in Grand Canal at the same rate that was offered to us by the owner because of the low season. However, the owner kept on mentioning about the low rate he offered us in the e-mail. We are not fools enough to know that almost all the hotels were offering the discounted rate in low season. After talking to the owner, we regretted the idea of cancelling our previous booking. We had an issue with carrying our luggage to the apartment. Even though it is close from railway station, but it can be a major hassle if you are carrying heavy luggage and if you could not get any help from anyone to carry your luggage across the bridge. Overall, it was a very disappointing stay, which was made even more unpleasant by the ownerâ€™s response. I would not recommend the apartments in Residence Palazzo to any one of my friends.","ratings":{"Overall":1.0},"author":"Lacey Kozey","date":"2014-03-03 22:54:03 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed here for three nights in a 2 bedroom cottage. We were looking for somewhere to stay at a budget price and this place was mentioned when I submitted a question on here loo king for budget motel in LA. The lady who owns the motel showed us round when we arrived and explained parking arrangements because parking is very tight, but not a problem. but free which is a bonus in LA. Rooms were clean with fridge and microwave. The rooms are not ultra modern but at the price you pay this place is a real bargain. Complimentary breakfast in the morning bagels/fruit and cereal. Nice Mexican/sports bar up the street and Ralphs supermarket in opposite direction.

Rooms are very clean, but they're so small I had to leave my bags on the bed during the day to be able to use the room, and it was impossible to use the bathroom without spilling water on the floor, even when just washing the face. The ads said restaurant, but it was closed for some reason I couldn't confirm. This was a big problem, as there were no proper places to eat within a ten to fifteen minute walking distance. We were also promised city vies, but the only city I saw was the wall from the opposing building five meters from my window on the ninth floor. If I knew what I was paying for, this hotel is just fine, but lack of restaurant, no city view, and the impossible size of the rooms put me off recommending this hotel for anything more than a necessary sleep-in for a night. Beds and sheets were top notch, though.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":2.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Delphine Kiehn","date":"2013-01-19 00:56:58 +0300"},{"content":"We booked 3 rooms accommodated 3-2-2 persons, stayed for 3 nights.

The room was deluxe twin bed. Although the room and its bathroom were small, they're kept clean everyday. Staffs were good and the thing I like most about this hotel is its location. The nearest MTR station is Prince Edward to which you can walk within 10 minutes comfortably. There was a night when me and my family were out so late that the MTR closed and we decided to walk from Mong Kok area. And the distance wasn't that far.
