My husband and I spent 5 days at the Riu Palace we returned on July 1st. It was our first time in the Dominican Republic. The facilities are comfortable, beautiful and very clean. We loved the included minibar! The beach is spacious and beautiful and the water is warm and clear. The staff is very helpful and friendly. But my husband got really sick on our last night there. I also felt sick but was not as sick as my huband. We did not drink the water but have to admit that my husband probably tried almost everthing on the bufett so I really don't know if he just got sick beacuse he overate. Overall we loved the facilities, pool, ocean, shops! We recommend the sunset cruise for adults....even though the boat is small and not fancy it is lots of fun and a good chance of seeing the area and other hotels from the boat, swimming, snorkling and meeting people.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":-1.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":-1.0},"author":"Bridie Kris","date":"2012-06-24 04:43:55 +0300"},{"content":"Perfect relaxing vacation destination! I read many of the reviews before our trip, and feel like I was at a different resort than those with all the problems. We had a wonderful relaxing vacation. We're in our mid thirties, and just wanted to get away with no plans. This is perfect. (If you're looking for a place for kids, or for exciting places to see and visit, this is not for you.) They did have activities throughout the day to take advantage of like beach volleyball, a work out area, dancing, aerobics, and ongoing nightly festivities surrounding the dinner. (Mexican night, Caribbean night, bar-b-q at the pool, etc.) The 脗 entertainment/shows脗 were not worth going to, but I expected that. We went to the disco one night, and the casino another, and took some long walks along the beach. The people who worked there were FANTASTIC! So upbeat, always friendly and helpful with every request. (And I consider myself pretty demanding) The tips that were most helpful included: bring plenty of singles so you can tip those that are most appreciated easily. Bring an insulated mug or larger to hold drinks colder longer. We used it for water with limes every day and were off at the beach. We brought 3 bottles of wine since we had heard the ones there weren脗 t so great, and it was great idea. If we didn脗 t finish it one night, they offered to hold it for us until the next night. Bring a clock for the room so you can see the time, and leave the rafts at home. It was no problem getting a chair by the pool or the beach. We were nervous with the weather forecast since it called for rain everyday, but rain is not like the US, it showers for about 5 minutes, and then passes and sunny like nothing ever happened. In seven days, we only had 1 totally cloudy day. (We were there March 24-31) It was great to use the Jacuzzi and they made sure that only this hotel's guests were there so we didn't feel crowded. (There were some people in it from the neighbor hotels and they nicely explained to them it was for Riu palace guests only) They told us that they were at about 85% capacity- so we had no problem with crowds. We did try the Caribe grill for dinner, cool place to go, but service not up to par with the El Patio buffet. (Plus you don脗 t get all the choices) We had a late breakfast and skipped lunch (which was usually leftovers from dinner the night before plus pizza) the food was ok- but nothing to rave about, especially after 7 days, but no complaints, lots of variety, so there was always something worth trying. The guests treated us fine (as Americans) but when you would get larger crowds of loud people, it was annoying and those tended to be Americans, so I would suggest going to one of the neighbor properties if you脗 re looking for a livelier atmosphere. I think if you go there with the right attitude, you won脗 t be disappointed. It probably helped to be able to speak Spanish, though, not a necessity. They were constantly cleaning the facilities and the beach to keep everything clean. They did have Internet facilities ($3 for every 20 minutes) if you want to stay in touch with people from home. We were on an Apple vacation and the apple reps were very friendly and helpful. A 5 or 6 day trip would have been perfect for this kind of trip and we would go back with no hesitation if we wanted this kind of relaxing vacation again some day. As for the drinks, you need to order a 脗 frozen脗 pina colada, or daiquiri, or you just get the pre-made mix which isn脗 t so good. And ask for it with extra alcohol or it doesn脗 t taste like much. (We didn脗 t realize this until near the end) Only one beer to choose from, but this seems the norm at other resorts also. You need to order from the bars that have blenders versus the one near the beach which just had the pre-made drinks and beer available. Enjoy the beautiful beaches and palm trees! Hope these tips help you enjoy your vacation as much as we did ours!","ratings":{"Service":-1.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":-1.0,"Check in / front desk":-1.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":-1.0,"Rooms":-1.0,"Location":-1.0},"author":"Erwin Kiehn","date":"2012-05-18 17:14:50 +0300"},{"content":"If You Don't Speak Spanish Don't Go I am writing this becuase people should know that there is a serious language barrier at this hotel. Most of the guest are European and treated us very badly and rudely. All of the entertainment is in Spanish, even the manager of the hotel only spoke a little English. The food was horrible, but the drinks were strong. I think the special was goat every night. I think my biggest complaint was the rude people; from the guest to the help. No one offered to help anyone. I actually hd to help an American couple get into there room because no one came to help them for 1/2 hour or more.","ratings":{"Service":-1.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":-1.0,"Check in / front desk":-1.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":-1.0,"Rooms":-1.0,"Location":-1.0},"author":"Gunnar Hermann","date":"2015-10-16 01:53:22 +0300"},{"content":"Great service and lot's of class! We just returned from the Palace. Dec. 25th. We had booked the Taino first and when we arrived I almost had a heart attack! No 5 star there! Anyway thank God I booked the hotel directly with RIU and I immediately switched to the Palace.The place was spotless and service for the Dominican was absolutely amazing! Been there three times and found the people rude and often lazy. This place was service with a smile the whole time. The management is very involved there presence was felt all over the place, we saw them everywhere. They run a very tight ship. I felt if I needed anything they would accomadate me. We had 2 kids with (age 9,6) they felt right at home, The towels and chairs were nice and cozy not old and weathered. The pool was very clean, the food was great and the buffet restaurant El Patio was very classy inside. The men must where long pants for all dinners there is a certain upper class feel to this hotel which was great , there was no bar flys hanging out at all the bars inhaling drinks because they are free! I hate it when the hotel is full of people who are there to take advantage of the free booze and food and act like this is there first holiday in there life! This resort was full of well traveled people and a very mature croud. The beach front was the best in front of the Palace the Iberostar was awful with a million yellow old chairs and straw huts everywhere! The Palace is a place I would definitely reccommend for relaxationan and quality with a smile.","ratings":{"Service":-1.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":-1.0,"Check in / front desk":-1.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":-1.0,"Rooms":-1.0,"Location":-1.0},"author":"Roscoe D'Amore","date":"2015-03-13 15:21:11 +0300"},{"content":"Gorgeous, Fabulous - Paradise What a trip! We just got back from spending our honeymoon at the Riu Palace Macao - and it was more beautiful than we could have imagined. The hotel was gorgeous, the people were so friendly, the food was first rate and the service was top notch.The beaches were immaculate with the white sands and blue water.
