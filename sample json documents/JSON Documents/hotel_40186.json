Had three rooms books for four nights each. All three rooms were very clean. Located us all on the same floor with an early check-in. Had two separate occassions to call the front desk on different nights to ask for help quieting some neighbors on the floor....seemed liked high school field trip participants who were exhuberant to be in NYC and away from their parents for the first time. Problems were resolved within five minutes each time. Tried San Rocco (restaurant adjacent to hotel) for drinks/snacks. Nice and reasonably priced for the city. Aside from a great location and rate, the staff at Wyndham Chelsea are always very professional, polite, and friendly.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Xander Schimmel","date":"2013-02-27 08:48:08 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Hope Shanahan","Elvie Bauch","Reed Dietrich Jr.","Magdalena Mayert","Adolph Goodwin","Samanta Adams","Helmer Grant Sr.","Keegan Wilderman","Maiya Wolff"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Breathtaking views over Menai Strait.
