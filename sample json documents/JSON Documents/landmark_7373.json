Traveling west of Panamint Springs on SR 190, turn left onto a dirt road that goes up a wash just before SR 190 starts climbing uphill. After about half a mile of dirt, gravel and rocks, there is a small parking lot.  From the parking lot, hike about half a mile to a mile further into the canyon. Since this is the drinking water supply for Panamint Springs, please do not jump in, no matter how tempting it is.","geo":{"lat":36.3206,"lon":-117.5253,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":7373,"country":"United States","city":"Inyo County","state":"California"}
