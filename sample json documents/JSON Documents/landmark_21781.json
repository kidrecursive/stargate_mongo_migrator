If so, you could do a lot worse than Gepetto, where you'll find a range of real bikes rather than the usual cheap MTB you'd see at a sporting goods store. Prices start at around €100 for a sturdy used, 3-speed city bike.","geo":{"lat":48.84021,"lon":2.35023,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"buy","type":"landmark","id":21781,"country":"France","city":"Paris","state":"Île-de-France"}
