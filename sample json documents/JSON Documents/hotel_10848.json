We stayed in a 'Kings Suite' which was spacious, comfortable and stylish. The large balcony gave great views over the Bosporus and Princes Islands and the dolphins were an added bonus. The staff are all very helpful. In particular, Sinan Erdogan, the manager, was there to arrange/fix/sort anything we needed. Be aware that there is a train track not too far from the back of the hotel and you will get some train noise. That said, it didn't bother us at all and we'll definitely be staying here again.

The hotel is so beautyful, the staff so very friendly, we felt like queens. I had asked for a room with seperate beds, and we got a free upgrade because they didt have seperate beds in the category we had booked. The room was very spacious, we could have a royal ball in there! Breakfast overlooking the marmara sea and blue mosque was not bad either! Only a few minutes walk from \"everything\". I am sure I will be back some day :-)","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Lily Wolf","date":"2013-07-05 08:39:06 +0300"},{"content":"My wife & I recently stayed at the Ferman Hotel for 11 nights. Although at the time there was some work being done on the new terrace roof it, did not disturb our stay. The hotel has been refurbished inside to an excellent standard. We stayed six(6) nights in the â€˜Ferman Roomâ€™ and then five(5) nights in one of the top floor â€˜Suitesâ€™. Both rooms were of a very high standard. The Suite had wonderful views of the Marmara Sea & City. The Manager Sinan and his staff could not have been more helpful. They arranged transport to and from the airport as well as transporting us to a local â€˜Fishâ€™ restaurant one evening. Just one note of caution, there is a railway line running along the back of the hotel, but bearing in mind that this is a lively city with calls to prayer five times a day the noise from the trains can be blocked out as the windows are double glazed & the room has air conditioning. Breakfast was very good, and Iâ€™m sure when the roof terrace is completed it will be a wonderful place to start your day! Already we are passing on the details of the Ferman Hotel to family and friends, and will happily return in the future. Thanks again Sinan to you & all your staff.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Frederique Pollich","date":"2012-05-05 14:28:39 +0300"},{"content":"Quite safe residential neighborhood. Decent breakfast. Rooms are clean and bathrooms are modern. Safe is large enough for laptops. Wi-Fi was horribly slow, and I needed fast internet (had some work to turn in during vacation), so I had to purchase a wi-fi subscription (found a cheap plan at a phone shop in Central Station). The hotel is nowhere near the center of Rome, but a metra stop is only 10 minute walk from hotel and there is a 24 hr city bus that stops in front of hotel. I took my 78 year old grandmother for Easter and it was extremely easy and cheap to get around Rome using public transportation. Not far is a laundry mat, several grocery stores, and many local shops. Good value for the money and distance isn't an issue if you're not shy about hopping on the local buses and trains.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Favian Bechtelar","date":"2012-06-12 12:16:27 +0300"},{"content":"As it was our first time in Italy we were a little nervous about finding a suitable hotel for what we needed. Fortunately for us, everything could not have gone better. We arrived at about midnight on the Saturday night and were greeted by reception who were very helpful. All staff speak perfect English and some even helped us with our Italiano. Situated in an ideal position just 900m from La Giustiniana train station, Veio Park Hotel ticks all the boxes for your stay in Rome. It is approximately a 15-20 minute train ride to the city centre and just the perfect distance away to escape the busy city environment. Surrounding the hotel in nearby streets you have supermarkets, cafes, restaurants etc which will come in handy. The in-house Restaurant has an amazing authentic Italian menu with friendly staff to assist. Highly recommended hotel. Had an amazing time. Thank you Rome, we will be back!!","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Elody Jacobson","date":"2014-10-26 00:06:12 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed 3 nights here and thought it was a lovely hotel. It may be a little far out of the city centre for some people but we enjoyed escaping the city after a day of exploring and it was easy to get to on public transport. The train was very cheap and didn't take too long at all and although the last train back is 10:15ish there is also a night bus starting at midnight which drops you off right outside the hotel. The hotel looks out over beautiful countryside so eating breakfast with a gorgeous view makes it worth the distance from the city. Rooms are spotless and well equipped with everything you could need. Staff are friendly and helpful with good local knowledge and there are even discounts for nearby restaurants which we enjoyed visiting- much more authentic and a lot cheaper than the city centre. Overall a great stay and we would recommend if you're happy to give public transport a go. Only tip would be to double check the train you are on stops at the station for the hotel as we got on a fast train that didn't and had to go back again!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Miss Aron Considine","date":"2015-12-28 04:35:47 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Alessandro Blanda","Louie Marquardt","Chloe Morar","Kristian Kiehn","Ellsworth Wilderman MD"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Both the hotel and hostel are a short distance from the wall.
