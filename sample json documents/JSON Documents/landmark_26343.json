San Rafael was a hospital mission, tending the sick from Spanish settlements and natives.  The first mission secularized, it was used by General John C. Fremont during the Mexican-American War, and during statehood as the Marin County Courthouse.  The original church was torn down in 1861, and a series of Catholic churches were erected at that site. The mission chapel has been restored in 1949, and tours of the site as well as a museum containing three original mission bells are open to the public.","geo":{"lat":37.974498,"lon":-122.527753,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":26343,"country":"United States","city":"San Rafael","state":"California"}
