Good wine list too and lovely leafy garden out the back. There is a great little music venue downstairs and even accommodation on the top floor. As a music venue, the Troubadour has been programming acoustic music since the 1950s when Bob Dylan et al took to the stage. It's bigger now and has gone electric but is still one of the best venues in London for up and coming talent. The musical spectrum is broad. On any night you might catch solo singer-songwriters or full bands. No heavy rock or covers bands though. More recently it has hosted Adele, Laura Marlin, Jamie T and The Kleeks. There is a good menu too but arrive early to get a table. It can get very busy. Well worth a visit.","geo":{"lat":51.48896,"lon":-0.19163,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":16393,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null}
