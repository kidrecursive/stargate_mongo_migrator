A walking tour round Belper is sometimes available from here taking you through the Cluster housing, past a nailmaker's workshop, along the jittys (aka gennels, channels, alleys, snickets, passageways) up to St John's Chapel (13th century) and finishing in one of the 30 or so pubs within a short walk.
