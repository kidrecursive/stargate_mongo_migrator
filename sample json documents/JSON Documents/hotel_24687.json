We arrived late (around 10pm) but even then had to wait half an hour to check in. When we finally got to a receptionist she advised that we had been upgraded. Having reserved a room with a king bed or 2 queens we werent quite sure what to expect. However, when we got to our room we discovered we had been allocated a dreadful room. It had a really odd layout; the lounge area was bigger than the sleeping area and the two were separated with a wall which blocked out most of the light from the one small window. To add insult to injury the bed was a standard double and they had left a pull out bed in the lounge area. We asked for the pull out to be moved immediately as it took up so much space and it was still there an hour later - when we called down to again we were told it would be in the next hour - this was at 11.35pm so we told them the next five minutes or not to bother - we were just on the point of moving it into the corridor ourselves some 20 minutes later when someone finally came to take it away. To top it all off we were right next to the lift shaft and, being Vegas, we could hear the lifts all night. We had gone straight downstairs to complain when we were first shown the room but received a none to helpful or friendly response - the long & short of it being they were full so we could put up and shut up and try again the next morning to see if we could be moved. When we asked what was \"upgrade\" about that particular room we were told it was the view. Our view from our less than big window was the car park. The following morning we went downstairs at 10pm to see if there was another room available (on the way we could see just how awful our room was compared to others which were much more spacious, had king or 2 queen beds and big picture windows) and were told this would be possible but that they could not give us the room number until 12 noon. We were only in Vegas for 4 days and frankly did not want to spend half a day waiting around in the hotel but seemingly had little choice so we went to the pool area. The staff there were just as indifferent to their guests and made no show of hiding their boredom. There was nothing attractive about the pool area - all flat hard concrete with nothing to soften the edges (no planting nothing, just sunbeds and the pool and very little shade with only a few umbrellas). On top of this they had R & B blaring from the speakers situated all around the pool - this was so loud that it drowned out my ipod. It was the straw that broke the camel's back and after 15 minutes i went down to research alternative accommodation on the internet. When we went to check out 1/2 an hour later the reception made it clear that they really couldnt have cared less. I've since written to the hotel to complain and not even received a response. The only plus point? The door staff - they were totally charming and polite - a complete contrast to the reception staff who really couldnt give a damn - they could certainly learn a few lessons from them. I wouldnt recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":3.0,"Location":1.0,"Rooms":1.0},"author":"Javonte Grady","date":"2015-09-30 23:37:02 +0300"},{"content":"I stayed with my friend at the Stratosphere hotel. This wasn't my first stay, I went there with my family several times. Every stay was simply GREAT! I really love the value you get in this hotel. Okay, it isn't in the \"heart of the Strip\" but you can get there very fast. We had a very spacious, clean room and paid only $40 per night! This is an amazing deal! Furthermore, we ate at the \"Top of the world restaurant\" which was an amazing experience!! We loved, loved the view over the whole city and the food was great! The service was brilliant and the staff very friendly!! If you stay at the Stratosphere don't miss the restaurant and the bar on top of the tower! Try to make reservations, it can get really crowded, especially on the weekends. We really liked the pool, it offers sunbeds and also towels for the guests. Even if not located in the middle of the strip, Stratosphere is a really nice location to spend your Vegas expirience. Why not saving a little money on accomodation and spend the saved money on gambling or nightlife? Stay at the Stratosphere, it's a great place!","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":3.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Buck Casper","date":"2013-06-14 17:06:10 +0300"},{"content":"Our 3rd visit to the Stratosphere just a couple of days this time. In a year there are some signs of a downward trend. The buffet while good value at $24.99 a day has gone down in quality and variety. It was amongst the best previously in my opinion. Our room upgrade never materialised and the one we received was very drab and dark and ill equipped compared to previous visits. The comps and cash backs have significantly reduced. The slots were much tighter. The staff were very helpful friendly and polite. Its position is now compromised having become a sleazy area at night and appreciably away from the main strip attractions. Very good value for money however and its acceptable for a short stay. Free gaming lessons in the morning and cheap tournament places always available. Use the Deuce Bus to travel the strip $7 / 24hr unlimited usage - goes right out to the Premium Mall at the opposite end of town,","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":4.0,"Location":2.0,"Rooms":3.0},"author":"Queenie Koepp","date":"2013-07-27 14:00:51 +0300"},{"content":"Loved it - not too tizzy, or \"themed\" beyond the boundaries of taste to witihn an inch of its life. Yes, it's right up one end of the Strip, but we liked this. Being away a little from all the hustle suited us just fine. If you are inclined you can walk the length of the Strip from the Stratosphere, or you can use the Deuce - a cheap bus that meanders slowly along. Our room was great - 22nd floor, great view, clean, very comfortable beds. All the staff were very frinedly, helpful and courteous. We ate in several different areas of the hotel as well as having room service on our first night and enjoyed them all. The buffet was great value with plenty of choice of food. The bar prices were very cheap compared to toher hotels on the Strip.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Rebecca Luettgen","date":"2014-11-23 18:23:42 +0300"},{"content":"We were out visiting family in the Las Vegas area and we always stay at the Stratosphere. We tend not to wander the Strip, been there done that, and wanted a hotel that we could relax in and really enjoy Las Vegas and it's beautiful desert. I love that there is ample parking and the hotel staff is always helpful. We had a problem with the TV remote not working, we thought it was maybe the batteries not working, but they came up w/a spare remote and a tech to see if there was something more with the TV. Once they realized it was actually the TV the tech quickly fixed it and was extremely courteous. We've never had a problem at the Stratosphere and will always stay here whenever we visit Las Vegas. The views at the top of the observation deck on the tower are fabulous! The city itself has many wonderful museums and parks, explore them you'll see that Las Vegas is an amazing destination.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Reece Hermann","date":"2013-05-04 19:49:12 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Ibrahim Bosco","Issac Nienow Sr.","Adaline Halvorson","Jayme Ratke","Luz Heidenreich PhD","Norene Dach","Savanna Krajcik"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Nice hotel with friently service.
