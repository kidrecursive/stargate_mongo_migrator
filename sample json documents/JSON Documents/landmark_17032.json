Built between 1180 and 1480, it is mostly of Gothic style with Romanesque elements; the oldest parts are the chancel and the lateral chapels, and as one goes towards the façade, the style becomes more and more Gothic. The cathedral hosts a spectacular astronomical clock originally built in the 14th century but modified later. It is especially worth seeing when the bells ring, daily on the hour from noon-4PM. Over the main door, the rose window, known as the &quot;Lamb rose window&quot;, is an admirable work of art depicting the life of St Stephen and St John the Baptist.","geo":{"lat":45.7606,"lon":4.8275,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":17032,"country":"France","city":"Lyon","state":"Rhône-Alpes"}
