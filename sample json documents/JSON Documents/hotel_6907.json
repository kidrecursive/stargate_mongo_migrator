The bed was very comfortable. Once we checked in we took a quick nap and headed down to the craps table. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. The food and the band at Toby Keith’s bar were great. The Range Steak House was incredible. I can’t wait to come back.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Name Heaney","date":"2012-06-13 12:00:36 +0300"},{"content":"If you are looking for the bargain hotel, centrally located on the The Strip, then Harrah's is for you! We stayed on the Southern end of the strip before and it was FAR to get to where 'the action' was. This time, we tried Harrah's...and for the price, it was perfect. I had a group of 18 people (9 rooms) and not one person complained. Everyone liked the hotel's location on the strip, comfort of the beds, and value. Only thing I will be leary of is the 24 hour buffet package that they sell....if you plan on staying close to those locations, watching the time closely (if eating is what you want to do), then this is for you....if you are, on the go type, this may not be your thing....they are STICKLERS when they say 24 hours....as we were standing in line for buffet when our's expired.....didn't honor it....spoke to managers and they all had same reply...\"no exceptions, it's 24 hours!\". So, stear clear of that...unless gambling and eating is the ONLY thing you do. (There are several buffets, at several hotels included...you just have to PLAN where you'll be for 'feeding time'.) Didn't work for us, but may work well for others. Over all, we would stay there again.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Ms. Destiney Cummings","date":"2015-07-12 00:48:19 +0300"},{"content":"I spent 7 nights at Harrah's at the end of August 2011. I obtained a fabulous deal for flights and accommodation through Travel bag but it did involve 3 flights there and back! Not for the faint hearted. Having gotten such a good deal I was a little worried about the hotel standard. I have been to Las Vegas before so I knew Harrahs was in a good location and furthermore I checked previous comments on Tripadvisor about the hotel but quite frankly they did not do it justice. If you want five star do not even consider Harrahs but for a no frills four star this is your place! I booked a smoking room and when I arrived the Receptionist said she had none. I was about to complain when she offered a room with a balcony which you could smoke on - first tick for the hotel. The room was close to the lift ( without asking ) thus near the ice machine and soft drinks machine. Some might think this would be a noisy locale but we were not disturbed. Room had two large double beds, 37 inch LCD LG TV and a smaller one in the bathroom!!! The room was immaculately cleaned every day and extra towels left without having to ask. - big tick here! We were not overlooking the swimming pool nor the night club so no noise disturbance but in fact could see the Mirage hotel opposite and a great view of the mountains in the distance ( fantastic sunsets!) Looking down wasn't the best view - but who's looking down! Staff were friendly in all areas- quite frankly can't say enough about them especially as it was so busy and they still kept smiling! Loved the Oyster Bar, loved drinks in the pool - watch out for the cocktails in the Harrah cups - $17.00 a pop but you only need one; but beyond a doubt the best thing about Harrah's is the dueling piano bar. It is rocking from Thursday to Saturdays; still good on the other nights but not quite as busy. it closes at 2am so we would get there from 12 on wards. There are many places to go to in Las Vegas but loved coming back to the piano bar. When that is closed if you have any energy go to the night club outside the entrance to the hotel - another rocking place! Las Vegas has become more expensive over the time I have been going there but of course the free drinks at the slots and gambling tables can make a difference there and you can still eat cheap if you look around. But make Harrah's you base. Unless I win the lottery and thus go back & stay in the Wynn then Harrahs' will be my first choice every time!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Alvena Simonis","date":"2012-12-12 17:07:09 +0300"}],"public_likes":[],"vacancy":true,"description":"Established in 1977, with over 750 handpicked and personally inspected holiday cottages throughout Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Somerset.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":true}
