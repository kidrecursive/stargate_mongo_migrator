The prepaid rate of $195 was an extremely good value, given the room quality, service, gym, and use of the BMW (we got a ride to brunch one morning). Our view was not good, but I presume those rooms are part of the upper pricing tier. I have absolutely no doubt that we'll stay there again if this pricing continues. If it increases to Peninsula-levels, we'll probably re-evaluate.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Mr. Gina Ortiz","date":"2013-04-04 21:55:22 +0300"},{"content":"The Elysian has raised the bar on luxury accommodations in Chicago. The hotel decor is elegant, but not stuffy or pretentious like the Peninsula. The staff is extraordinary. Many defected from other luxury hotels in Chicago to be part of something special. The rooms are warm and inviting, filled with enough tech to impress even the most jaded traveler. Rates are pricey, but you get what you pay for, and factoring in the no tip policy (nice touch) the Elysian is well worth the price.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Ernie Deckow","date":"2015-06-27 20:55:21 +0300"},{"content":"The rooms are models of restraint and elegant design.
