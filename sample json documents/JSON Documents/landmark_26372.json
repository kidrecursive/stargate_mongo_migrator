It is named after its builder, local lumberman John P. Stearns. Badly damaged several times by fire, it has been repeatedly rebuilt and today features more than a dozen shops and restaurants, and one of the best views in California from the end of its pier. You may see brown pelicans at the end of the wharf. It was once owned by Hollywood legend James Cagney.","geo":{"lat":34.408096,"lon":-119.684936,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":26372,"country":"United States","city":"Santa Barbara","state":"California"}
