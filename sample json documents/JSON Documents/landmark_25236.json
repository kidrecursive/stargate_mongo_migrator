{"title":"San Diego/Mission Beach-Pacific Beach","name":"Cass Street Bar and Grill","alt":null,"address":"4612 Cass Street","directions":null,"phone":"+1 858 270-1320","tollfree":null,"email":null,"url":null,"hours":null,"image":null,"price":null,"content":"This comfortable, laid-back bar with deep sea fishing themed decor has a good crowd at practically any time of the day, night or week. It's a beer and wine bar, so be advised any cocktails drinks actually use an weak asian vodka called Han Vodka, but the twelve or so beers on tap and various other bottled beers are enough to keep most customers happy. The profusion of TV screens make it a popular daytime sports bar, the pool tables and shuffle board table keep it popular at night. The menu has some great seafood and burgers, served until about 10pm, and has great breakfast options too. This bar has a much more neighborly feel compared to the meat-market atmosphere of some of the more popular Garnet Street bars.","geo":{"lat":32.79852,"lon":-117.25239,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":25236,"country":"United States","city":"San Diego","state":"California"}
