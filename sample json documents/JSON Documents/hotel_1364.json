After a long flight to Istanbul, we were extremely tired. When we arrived at the hotel, we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the hotel. It was very clean and and luxurious. Bathroom was large. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommended this hotel to any one looking for a 4 to 5 star accommodation at a reasonable price. The location is very close all old town attractions.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Marianne Wintheiser","date":"2012-06-08 20:18:06 +0300"},{"content":"A hotel suite is normally means a connected series of rooms to be used together and not a single room as was provided. I booked what was described as Suite Executive Room and expected what I would normally get from a suite: a separate bedroom and other living area. I wanted a larger room because I was staying 8 days. I got s single room - clearly not a suite - at what was really an outrageous price. This really is misleading advertising and not acceptable. The street where the hotel is located has many other hotels and hostels as well as bars and restaurants. It is fairly downmarket with any walk down the street resulting in being accosted by touts for each. The hotel has a basic restaurant serving uninspiring food. The breakfast buffet is limited and poor. There is a very small range of breakfast cereals and fruit and some poor cold meat products that are really only suitable for feeding to the many cats in the area. There is a top floor open-air balcony but, unlike other hotels, this has no awnings or canopies and so is quite unusable in the hot afternoons. There is a separate smaller balcony area off the fourth floor but this is unfinished. There was building work and associated noise that went on until around 8:00 pm some days but this was not mentioned anywhere on the hotelâ€™s Web site. And on a final note; rooms were typically not made-up until after 4;00 pm. When we arrived back one day after 4:00 pm we were told our room was not cleaned and were offered a drink while we waited. These drinks appeared on our bill at check-out. I have to say that my experience with this hotel is so completely at odds with that of others that I feel something is fundamentally wrong. I selected the hotel based on the Tripadvisor reviews and, based on this experience, have a significantly reduced trust in reviews on this site. The very poor value for money and overall experience invalidates any minor saving graces such as cleanliness.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Location":2.0,"Rooms":1.0},"author":"Deondre Predovic III","date":"2013-04-12 20:40:47 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Ms. Saige Hauck","Mr. Letha Lemke","Queen Farrell"],"vacancy":true,"description":"5 star hotel housed in a 700 year old converted townhouse","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
