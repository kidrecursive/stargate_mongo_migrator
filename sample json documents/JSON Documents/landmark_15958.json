This was once the home of the 'Ladies of Llangollen' from 1780 to 1831 and their tomb can be found in the grounds of St Collen's Church in Llangollen (which you will see on your right as you enter via the A5). The inside has many intricate carvings many brought by visitors (including the Duke of Wellington) to the ladies - Miss Sarah Ponsonby and Lady Eleanor Butler. The two women are amongst the most celebrated of the town's former residents and originally arrived after eloping from their families in Ireland. The exact nature of their relationship is ambiguous, however they formed a lifelong partnership until they died within two years of each other in 1829 and 1831.","geo":{"lat":52.9671,"lon":-3.1655,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":15958,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Llangollen","state":null}
