It’s only a block away from the beach. It’s divided into three sections, the first being an inside section with a jukebox and two pool tables. The next is a canopy-covered outside section that’s just as big as the inside. This area is good for lounging or smoking a cigarette. Behind the patio is the third section: a dance floor where the DJ spins hip hop and dance music. A separate door with the façade Club Tremors can take you directly to this area from outside the bar. If you arrive after 10, there’s usually a line to get in. And don’t forget the “Grill” part of PB Bar and Grill; they serve up some great grilled American dishes and appetizers. Inquire about their happy hour specials and nightly drink specials. Tuesdays are “Taco Tuesdays” and Thursdays are $2 you-call-it’s.","geo":{"lat":32.79699,"lon":-117.25455,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":25237,"country":"United States","city":"San Diego","state":"California"}
