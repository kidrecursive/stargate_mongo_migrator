It is co-located with Napoleon Bonaparte's tomb (entry to which is included in the ticket price). Most of the exhibitions are very old fashioned, and the coverage of the First World War is surprisingly limited. A highlight is the Musée des Plans-Reliefs, which displays painstakingly accurate models of French fortresses and includes its own shop.","geo":{"lat":48.85605,"lon":2.31157,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":21800,"country":"France","city":"Paris","state":"Île-de-France"}
