I can't see how for the excellent value for money why anyone could be negative. Being really close to Central Park 10 mins and only 15 minutes by subway to Times Square and 30 mins to Greenwich Village and 45mins to Battery Park it is great. The Upper West side is very relaxed with great local restaurants near by. The Key West Diner next door to the hotel is great for breakfast, the DIVE BAR on 732 Amsterdam Ave 2 mins behind the hotel is great for relaxed beer and burgers and for a delicious local Italian you must try Gennaro 5 mins away on 665 Amsterdam Ave. The bottom line is the Hotel Newton provides a relaxed, quiet hassle free experience and we loved our trip!
