The thing that I liked the most is the convenience of the location. The fact of having the mall across from the lobby was awesome!!

From rude staff to registration mix-ups, my experience has taught me to start a new hotel relationship with extreme caution. However, from the moment I began working with Jessica and her team at the Florida Hotel & Conference Center, I could tell this was going to be different. The sales staff was friendly, knew their stuff and very responsive. Barry stepped in beautifully even while Jessica was away so we could keep our planning on schedule. They were very flexible with my rooming and event needs and never made me feel like I was inconveniencing them. I had unconventional room layout needs and they were more than willing to work with me on those. Coordinating 350 people from 22 states into 2 days was not easy, but they make it look that way. The banquets team was also especially helpful, not making us wait more than a few minutes to follow through on room changes. Kudos to Verna for running such a sharp and well run machine! My only regret is that this team canâ€™t follow us when we do events in other states! All hotels can learn much from the open communication, friendliness and commitment to customer satisfaction that the Florida Hotel & Conference Center Team have. If youâ€™re planning an event and want it to be a success, make them your first choice.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Ismael O'Connell","date":"2012-08-11 01:40:15 +0300"},{"content":"Fast check-in, Beautiful inside and out. All employees were very friendly. Rooms were very clean and comfy. The location is excellent. My daughter loved the doorbell at every suite. Very secure, must use room key for elevator to go above 2nd floor.

Used this property every year for the last 20 years for large and small meetings, and every year is better than the last. Reason: They stay ahead of the renovation curve, meeting space needs, and they care about their guests. Sleeping rooms are very nice and extremely comfortable ... pillow-top beds, flat screen TVs, refrigerators, safes, high speed internet, make up mirrors and good lighting in every room. Beautiful, new heated swimming pool and fitness center. Wonderful restaurant, lounge and Starbuck's Cafe. Location is great, attached to the Florida Mall for a wonderful shopping experience. The service and staff are the best anywhere ... and the value is great! Everything you need for successful meetings! I have 4 more meetings booked in January ...","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Marley Quigley PhD","date":"2014-12-25 06:48:14 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Tess Borer","Arthur Hessel DVM","Mr. Jamarcus Ziemann","Mr. Beulah Kuhn","Tierra Trantow","Jarred Koss Sr.","Candice Kulas","Santino Jacobs","Marcia Grant DDS"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Built in the fifteenth century, this former hotel was long the residence of the nobles who accompanied the court of the sovereign Kings of France.
