The Thai menu is authentic and very tasty and service is quick. Very close to the Old Vic and around 10 minutes walk from the Southbank Centre: a great alternative to Southbank's uninspiring chain restaurants whether you are on a strict budget or not.","geo":{"lat":51.5017,"lon":-0.111,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":16324,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null}
