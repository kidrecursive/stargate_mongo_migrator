The lobby bar looks like it belongs in a budget motel. The paint on the bathroom door in our room, and that of our fellow travelers, was quite chipped. We have stayed in other Doubletree Hotels and fell well short of the standard of the others. We were only staying 2 nights so we didn't move hotels, but our fellow travelers who were staying in New Orleans 2 more nights moved to another hotel.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":2.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Nella Ratke","date":"2013-07-12 12:18:02 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Nash Kihn"],"vacancy":false,"description":"This grandiose olde worlde railway hotel - once one of the city's most prestigious hotels - has been recently refurbished and restored to its former glory.","alias":"Grand Central Hotel","pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":false,"free_parking":false}
