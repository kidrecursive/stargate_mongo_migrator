The waiters all look to have been there from day one, so a patron knows they’re in for a great culinary experience. The tiny bar in front of what is a tiny restaurant is often crammed three deep. It’s still a place one could be having a drink next to a movie star or ‘someone of note.’ Cocktails flow as waiters rush by carrying popular menu items such as linguini, spaghetti carbonara, steamed clams and a 16oz. New York steak dubbed the Dabney Coleman (an actor). The joint is always crowded and serves late into the night; a reservation is a must save for heavyweight Hollywood types. Excellent service, red banquettes, a classic atmosphere and delicious food – that’s a recipe for success and why Dan Tana’s remains a consistent favorite.","geo":{"lat":34.081762,"lon":-118.389091,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":33244,"country":"United States","city":"West Hollywood","state":"California"}
