'''Stamford Bridge''' has tours on non-matchdays, though the tickets are fairly pricey, as is the Club Shop for souvenirs. It is the one of the best supported teams, hence tickets are hard to come by, unlike QPR and Fulham to a lesser extent. The stadium has an illustrious history, dating back to before the foundation of the team, and is worth a visit as it may not be around in a couple of years time, if Chelsea's owner has his way. | image=Stamford Bridge from the air.jpg","geo":{"lat":51.4817,"lon":-0.1911,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":16148,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Stamford_Bridge_from_the_air.jpg"}
