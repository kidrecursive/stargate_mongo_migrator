Among the many highlights of this museum is the building itself; ride the elevator to the top to see the '''Living Roof''', a literal green roof and marvel of architecture with soft hills covered in grass and flowers. On the ground floor are numerous interactive science exhibits, outdoor gardens, an aviary, and towering over the massive exhibit halls is the sphere-like '''Planetarium''' on one side of the building, while the other side is overshadowed by the domed '''Rainforests of the World''' exhibit, a massive transparent dome which contains a winding pathway that takes you to the top, past towering trees and animal displays. As if all that wasn't enough, the building also contains a fantastic '''aquarium''' on the bottom floor, which showcases the more unusual sea life such as octopus, jellyfish, sea dragons, and sea stars among its displays of coral reefs, kelp forests, and tidepools. It's a big museum; be sure to give yourself at least a few hours to see it all.","geo":{"lat":37.7698,"lon":-122.4661,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":26062,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
