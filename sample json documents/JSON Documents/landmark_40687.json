They make a variety of whites and reds, including a super tasty rose. They also make kosher wines which they sell out of quickly. The inside tasting room features the platinum albums that Cohn received for the Doobie Brother's successes. The gift shop sells not only award winning olive oil and balsamic, but also smoking pipes (only in California...). They are also known for live music events where the Doobies, Melissa Etheridge, and other award winning musicians rock out in front of the vineyards to huge audiences.","geo":{"lat":38.349212,"lon":-122.501732,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":40687,"country":"United States","city":"Glen Ellen","state":"California"}
