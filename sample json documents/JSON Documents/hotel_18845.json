From here you can walk to both. The Hilton Garden Inn was comfortable and clean. Our king sized bed was so comfortable I slept better than I do at home. It is attached to the Maryland Athletic Club which guests can use. The only unusual thing is that it shares a building with another hotel. The Garden Inn is on one side and the Homewood Suites is on the other side of the lobby. Parking was $25 per night. Not unusual for a hotel in a major city.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Carleton Jenkins","date":"2015-06-06 17:57:27 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Dorcas Paucek","Emely Beatty","Pearline Miller","Elisha Hand","Omari Kiehn","Tyrell Stroman","Scot Mitchell","Ewald Kautzer"],"vacancy":true,"description":"A contemporary respite from the busy streets of Cannery Row.
