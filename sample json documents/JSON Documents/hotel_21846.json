The resort is south of Wailea on a secluded, beautiful beach, but still close enough to take advantage of the restaurants in Wailea or Kihei. We were told at check-in that the room renovations had been complete. Our room was comfortable with a partial ocean view and a lovely lanai, but the carpet was dirty in several places. Occasionally, we found tiny bugs in the bathroom. Whatâ€™s worse was all the light switches were filthy! Iâ€™ve never experienced that anywhere. We had purchased a package on Expedia that included the breakfast buffet (normally $25pp). The selection was great. Two days we had great service (bringing beverages and removing plates) but the third day we had to ask for coffee after looking for a server for 10 minutes. The service at the pool at lunch time was also poor. (There is nowhere else to eat at the resort at lunch time.) When we first arrived at the pool, the waitperson kept asking us if we wanted to order and we said not yet. When we told her we were ready to order, she forgot about us for about 15 minutes. She also forgot a couple of other things that we requested during the afternoon. We were there in early December and the resort seemed like it had were more staff than guests. Maybe the resort was still getting back to normal after the renovation, but it was a little spooky with only a few people around. In sum, I think I would stay there again because of the location and beach and hope that the service and cleanliness had improved.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Mrs. Myles Hackett","date":"2012-07-05 09:54:39 +0300"},{"content":"Here's the deal with this property. It's obvious that the new owners are still dealing with a massive restructuring/remodeling/rebranding project since acquiring the property last year. The result is that the prior negative reviews referencing the Adams Family, Hitchcock films, etc. are not completely offbase as the hotel is a bit stark and bland in general. I had already stayed for a few nights in West Maui so I only wanted 2 days/1 night in the Wailea area to check out South Maui before I left the island. I didn't want to pay $500+ for the Four Seasons or Grand Wailea and was able to book Makena for $199 inclusive of breakfast and the resort fee. The manager upgraded me to a better Ocean View room when I checked in without my having to badger him for it...in fact, the entire staff was very friendly and helpful the entire time I was there and are an asset to the hotel. I can confirm the prior reviews regarding the room...great views, nice bed, bland decor, elements that make you shake your head at the design flaws, cheap patio furniture that I constantly tripped over, etc. The hotel beach is nice. If you have a car drive to Big Beach 5 minutes down the road. Bottom line with this place is that it is a great value for South Maui if you get the room for a great rate, are not expecting a posh manicured Four Seasons/Grand Wailea experience, and are using it as a base to explore the island rather than sitting by the pool all day.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Adan Lueilwitz","date":"2013-05-10 11:30:56 +0300"},{"content":"We picked this resort off yahoo travel and got a awesome deal! The resort is massive, clean, and the people are amazing! We were greeted at the front by complimentary valet and a sea shell lei, check in was smooth and the valet had our bags in the room before we got there. The beach is big with plenty of lounge chairs and perfect for swimming and snorkeling. The room is nice sized with two queen beds and a big patio, the bathroom is big with a tub and seperate shower. Can't say enough good things about this place.

If your looking for quality off the strip but just a hop,skip and jump away this is the place. great beach and decent snorkeling that is sure to please most but the most discerning right off to the left point of hotel beach. Safe calm water in the a.m. for all family snorkeling and still fantastic for a swim in the afternoons. Turtles too! Now for such a great review i should get a comp but... well... they deserve it . Great place... unless you want a condo for big family. Even then you gotta visit the beach for a snorkel....on a scale of 1 to six i would rate this a 5 star","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Javonte Prosacco","date":"2014-07-16 21:17:03 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Abel Schultz","Kamryn Rosenbaum","Gene Schaefer","Delaney Schowalter","Mr. Oda Bogisich"],"vacancy":true,"description":"The legendary hotel overlooking Place de la Concorde has been the epitome of Parisian luxury for centuries, and now under new Saudi ownership undergoes a restoration scheduled to finish in 2015, when it will reopen as a Rosewood property.","alias":"Closed until 2015","pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
