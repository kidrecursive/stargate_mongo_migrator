My hubby and I came here for our anniversary and WOW was it ever ruined. when we first checked in, our room was not ready and so they went to put us on the 5th floor and the door looked like it had been kicked in and the people 3 rooms down was really loud having relations went to complain that we could not get into room and they said that they were going to put our things into another room until original room was cleaned and we went into room and I was pissed because there was drug paraphenalia all over the room and I took a first aid glove and picked up the crack pipe and took it to the front desk and the guy had the galls to insinuate that it was mine and I got mad and left for awhile and when we came back they moved us to another room and the mirror was on the floor by the wall and there was twin beds and we were right next to the antique elevator and ever time sone one came on or off of it the door slammed and woke us up. we left early and complained to the Howard Johnson Corporation and all the did was send us a coupon for $25.0 off saying that we can use it on our next visit.

We stayed for a week because we had prebooked the stay. Our room had a cracked sink that did not drain well and a large rip in the carpet. The bathroom overall was ancient. The selection at Breakfast was excellent the 1st two days and dismal the last five. This Inn is much like staying in a great aunts guest room, a bit worn and out of date but clean and tidy. It is also quite inexpensive. The location is good for public transportation too. Renovations and basic repairs are needed but it does give bargain rates,","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Business service":2.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":3.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Geovanny Jacobi","date":"2012-01-24 08:18:25 +0300"},{"content":"Lovely Hotel in a great location The Marina Hotel, San Francisco, is one of those gems you hope to find when travelling.Our room at the rear was quite and tastefully decorated. The staff, on the whole, were friendly and helpful.The location was fantastic. Fishermans Wharf was an attractive 20 minute walk through a park along the shore. The surrounding area was largely flat.Two blocks to the North along Union Street were many excellent expensive resturants. One blocks to the South on Chestnut Street were many excellent cheaper resturants. We ate at a resturant called 'Fusio' on Chestnut Street for three nights in a row, such was the quality and excellence of the $10-$15 meals. They had the best marinara I have ever had!The complimentary breakfast was the only minor downer, with only hard boiled eggs and muffins, with fruit juice and coffee. Some cereal would be a big improvement. However, it was free where most similar Hotels do not provide any breakfast at all.Overall, excellent value for money.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Business service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Lonzo Runte","date":"2014-12-27 23:17:03 +0300"},{"content":"Excellent Bargain For the cost ($65/night), this place was excellent. We had a very CLEAN room, somehow, in contrast to some other recent posts. The free internet and free continental breakfast added to the value. And the surrounding neighbourhood was great, although a little out of the way for the major attractions (maybe a 25 minute walk to the fisherman's wharf area). We spent a couple nights at the $200/night Hilton by Union Square after leaving the Marina Inn, and I ended up feeling that we would have been better off staying where we were, regardless of cost.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Check in / front desk":-1.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":-1.0},"author":"Reva Rippin","date":"2015-01-08 14:51:09 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Leanna Keeling","Armando Witting","Robb Weissnat","Jamar Roberts III","Isac Douglas"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Combining heritage with a modern approach, set in private grounds.
