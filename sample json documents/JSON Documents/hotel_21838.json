Location: a few minutes walk to beach and local mall Rooms: big, clean Internet: free (included in resort fee $10) Parking: free (included in resort fee), lots of spaces Pool: very small We got upgraded to a junior suite. The room was very open, doesn't feel cramped at all. We had trouble figuring out the shower and ended up calling the technician to come up because we thought it was broken. Apparently nothing was wrong, it was just a tricky shower. This was one of the cheap but still modern hotels in Maui. If you are looking for a resort kind of hotel, then this is not for you. But if you plan on hanging out all day and then just coming back to a good place for the night and to sleep, then Maui Coast Hotel is definitely a choice.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Felicia McDermott","date":"2012-10-26 20:30:36 +0300"},{"content":"The Hotel is very nice and the staff was very helpful except for the waiter at the pool bar he was horrible ! He dosent know anything about customer service! My husband and I went down to the pool to hear some of the live music and have a few drinks , needless to say we had to ask him to take our order because he was too busy talking about his property in another counrty and how he is getting ready to move there BIG THUMBS DOWN TO YOU !!

I must say that, thanks to overall good management and maintenance, timely remodeling and consistency in providing very good service to guests this property remains my favorite when staying on South Maui. The free WiFi internet access from every room is now a real plus as well as is free parking. However, donâ€™t be fooled: these perks and others are not really free so to speak and come with a mandatory USD17.50 + tax daily resort fee, something unique and contagious within Hawaiiâ€™s resorts that is simply extorsion to me. The deluxe minisuite room I was given was clean, quiet and smelled good with each and every items serviceable and was in line with my bookingâ€™s requests. I was therefore disappointed by the somewhat noisy window mounted not split A/C unit that made me use airplaneâ€™s earplugs in order to be less disturbed by the loud rumbling and vibrations. The flat panel TV set is hooked on a wall facing the sofa. However, since this TV is not moveable watching programs from your bed is not comfortable since you only get a limited side view. Housekeeping though well performed was taking place randomly from 9:am to 4pm thus being done most of the time when you donâ€™t expect it. Many times we came back from the beach around 3:30 PM to discover that our room was not ready forcing us to go down to the pool for an extra hour before being able to take a much needed shower in our room. However, these CONs will not prevent me from staying another time at this property next year.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Kendra Bergnaum","date":"2015-05-31 04:56:32 +0300"},{"content":"Good location in Kihei, central to most everything.

Last February (2011) we took our grown son and family. We had separate rooms/side by side. They were so kind and arrnanged this for us. Absolutely wonderful from the front desk to the cleaning staff to the cafe to the poolside service. We were there in Feb. for a month and loved every minute. We have booked to go \"again\" this coming February 2012. The beach is right across the street and shopping is close by. Spices restaurant is great for breakfast, but with so many restaurants close by - try them out. We have not had a terrible meal anywhere in Maui. The Maui Coast is simply affordable and very comfortable and very clean and soooo wonderful. Love it and cudos to the great staff. After returning 3 years in a row, one gets to know the staff and the same persons are there year after year. That has to say something for this \"wonderful\" hotel\"....Deb","ratings":{"Location":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Caden Rogahn","date":"2014-11-19 20:01:44 +0300"},{"content":"Pretty good accommodations. - pool was clean and right sized for size of hotel.

It was a perfect hotel for us in every way. We actually wished we had stayed in this hotel longer before changing locations. What we loved about this hotel: 1. The rooms were large and we had our own deck. 2. We had our own fridge, microwave, and coffeemaker in our room. 3. We could use the washer and dryers (located on the even floors) for free. 4. They provided beach/pool towels. 5. Happy hour at the bar from 3-6pm and a live band at the pool from 6-9pm. 6. The hotel is in walking distance to many eateries, shops and beaches. 7. If you wanted to go somewhere within 3 miles, the hotel shuttle would drive you there. 8. The pool wasn't large, but it was never crowded. 9. Bikes are offered to use at no charge if you would like. 10. Extremely comfortable beds. 11. Provided cotton balls, Q-tips, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the bathroom. The only thing I can think of that we didn't like about this hotel was the small parking spaces, but you'll find this all over the island.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":4.0},"author":"Wendy Williamson","date":"2013-10-23 20:12:57 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Georgiana Ledner","Keshawn Bode","Napoleon Welch","Ms. Caleigh Jenkins","Cielo Kuphal","Shaniya Thiel Jr.","Felicia Paucek","Kevin Jaskolski","Krystal Walker"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Brands itself as a boutique hotel, with unique décor combining classical and contemporary in a Haussmann-style building on the street of the same name. 25 double rooms with old-style furniture, air conditioning, satellite television, a telephone socket, Wi-Fi, and baths with both tub and shower.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":true}
