Prior to arriving I had sent an email to the Assistant Gen. Manager, who had responded to some other posts on this site. I told him that the trip was for my wifes birthday and asked if the hotel offered anything that I could purchase to make the stay more special. He was out of the office for the week so my email was forwarded to the Gen. Manager who upgraded our room to a suite with a balcony. While the room was a little small it was no smaller than any other rooms that we have stayed at in New York City. Upon check in the desk clerk mentioned my wifes birthday and provided us with vouchers for breakfast in the morning. We then went to a great local restaurant that was recommended to us by the Gen. Mgr. and when we returned to the room there was a nice desert with a birthday card from the staff and a balloon in the room. Very nice touch. Another post on this site mentioned noise being a problem but we didn't find that to be the case at all, we had a great nights sleep on both nights. We did stop in the restaurant that is attached to the hotel (Rocco's) for desert on the other night. I'm not sure if this is part of the hotel itself or just shares the same space but we weren't impressed with the restaurant. We were seated at the table for at least a 1/2 hour before our order was taken. We would absolutely stay at this hotel again and have already recommended it to friends. It was a short walk to Chelsea Market, and we also walked to Times Square which was a little far but definitely doable.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Isobel Kemmer","date":"2012-01-12 19:57:56 +0300"},{"content":"Stayed at Wyndham Garden Inn Chelsea seven nights, from December 23 to December 30, 2009. Most all hotels in Manhattan considered the last few nights of our stay as part of the high priced New Years Eve week. We were getting decent rates for the first 3 or 4 nights, but the last few nights tripled! We ended up calling hotels directly to ask for a lower price for those nights since we would be staying so long. Wyndham Garden Inn Chelsea was the only hotel that would adjust their prices. So we paid $149 for the first six nights and $229 for the last night, before taxes of about $20 a night. We paid about $40 for a taxi from LGA. The hotel is on 24th Street halfway between 5th and 6th Streets (a little closer to 6th), just one block over from the major cross-street in Chelsea, 23rd Street. There are subway stations all along 23rd street. The closest to the hotel is the FV station at 6th Avenue, but the 1, RW, 6 and CE stations arenâ€™t far within Â¼ mile. The location of the hotel is its best feature. There is quick access to all parts of the city. But Chelsea/Flat Iron is full of interesting shops and incredible restaurants. We walked to all of these restaurantsâ€¦ we had breakfast at Murrayâ€™s Bagel (on 8th Avenue south of 23rd Street), had the best BBQ brisket ever at RUB (on 23rd Street between 7th and 8th Avenue), had an excellent European brunch at Markt, enjoyed incredible soup at Pipaâ€™s inside the ABC Carpet Shop on Broadway, indulged in old fashioned diner-style meals at the Lyric Diner on 3rd Avenue, and even sipped shakes at Burger Shack in the Madison Square Park. The area has really fun for people watching. The hotel is obviously newly re-constructed. All the materials and fixtures are new. There is essentially no lobby. The doors open right at the front desk. There is a sofa and a couple ottomans but itâ€™s not a spot you would spend time. A ticket desk/concierge is squeezed into a corner. The restaurant is supposed to be a part of the hotel, but it didnâ€™t really seem that way. We never ate there. Room 903 is steps from the elevator and faces the front of the building. The small room was adequate for two people who travel well together but donâ€™t think of sharing a room with someone who getâ€™s on your nerves. It has a desk and chair, big flat screen TV on the wall, arm chair, two nightstands, a luggage rack and a closet equipped with an iron/board. There is no dresser. The king sized bed has a good quality mattress topped with a comfy feather bed. The sheets are good quality (probably 350-threadcount). The duvet and comforter are nice and cozy. The pillows are decent foam. The heating system was a little quirky; it made a lot of noise whenever it kicked on. But we got used to it and slept through the repeated ruckus. The bathroom is well equipped with a good-sized shower, decent towels, enough counter space and True Blue Spa soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. The water pressure and temperature were good. Except one morning there was no hot water. By the time we went down to the lobby, the repair truck was already parked in front of the hotel and they were repairing the frozen boiler. We had plenty of hot water when we returned that afternoon. Our room was cleaned completely and promptly when weâ€™d leave in the morning. Although no one knocked when we had the do not disturb sign on the door, the cleaning crew was very noisy. Two of them even got into a screaming match about who wasnâ€™t working fast enough! But everyone on the staff was very friendly to the guests. The hotel worked for us because we donâ€™t need a fancy lobby, an onsite restaurant or other services. It was a good value for the price compared to other hotels in Manhattan. It is in an area that we like and has good access to public transportation. If you travel like we do, youâ€™ll like this hotel.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":4.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":3.0},"author":"Tristian Kautzer","date":"2013-03-10 09:34:51 +0300"},{"content":"I would highly recommend this Hotel is you are interested in Location and Good Value for your Money. The Location for this Hotel is Great -Very close to Union Square, the Flatiron Building, Empire State Building, Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Chelsea and other landmarks. All within easy walking distance. It is also very convenient to many subway lines. The building is brand new and it is on a quiet street just one block beyond 23rd St. The building was nice, the room was good - not huge but it met our needs for a few days stay. We Got a Great Room Rate which was good for a Stay in New York. Most New York Hotels are too expensive and not worth the price, but this one was Great. For the same price, I would happily stay at this hotel again. The location, cleanliness, and price cant be beat. I am very glad that we stayed here as opposed to somewhere else. It met our Needs Very Well. The Staff was very friendly and helpful. We arrived later than usual and they checked us in quickly and had our room ready. They even offered us a discount rate for an extra nite or two for the room because we may have had to stay longer due to a heavy snowstorm that was about to hit the New York Metro area that day but we were able to leave before it arrived. That was really nice to offer that to us. Quality: I was impressed when we first entered the room. The hallway was warm, but the room was perfectly heated and comfortable as it was brutally cold outside. The room was very clean and cozy. Granted, it was a small but you have to expect that in Manhattan. We had no problems with it. I would highly recommend this hotel for location, value and its cool boutique style. Well worth it. Enjoy.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Magali Bruen","date":"2013-03-18 16:59:18 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed at the Wyndham Garden Chelsea for 5 days in May and thought the location was great. Very close to the subway line, Flatiron building and Madison Square Park. The room we stayed in was small but we only used it to sleep! So much to do in NY! A few comments for management would be: The bathroom could have been a bit cleaner, not sure the floor was cleaned before we checked in. When we asked the front desk about help with getting tickets to a Broadway show we were just told to \"check the internet\" A little more help, tips or ideas would have been nice. Lastly, a street/subway map of Manhattan would have been great. Most hotels give these out but the front desk only seemed to have a map of the Flatiron district. Over all a great stay here and would definitely recommend it to others as well as stay here again ourselves.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Sidney Schaefer","date":"2013-06-25 06:37:21 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Kendra McCullough","Wilfrid Cassin","Freeman Bauch","Tomasa Nikolaus"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Winner, Best Place to Stay (Self Catering) Wales National Tourism Awards 2013.
