The factory is in a small alley and it is tiny with only 3 people making fortune cookies. Tourists are welcome to walk in off the street &mdash; you get a flat (un-bended) fortune cookie sample but photos cost 50 cents and the moment you walk in they are asking you in their broken English what cookies you want to buy. It is a must see though!","geo":{"lat":37.7957,"lon":-122.4073,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25393,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
