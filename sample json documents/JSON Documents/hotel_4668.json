The room was $162 per night. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was plenty large enough for 2 people. We did not spend a lot of time in the room. Most of our waking hours were spent sight seeing. The room was very clean. The only drawback was that the room faced 46th street and thus was quite noisey. My wife and I are fairly sound sleepers so this did not really bother us that much. Other rooms may be much quieter. The breakfast provided was typical of many hotels. We ate shotly after the breakfast room opened (7:00 am) and found everything satisfactory. The breakfast was as advertised. There was only on small elevator. We did not experience any long waits. We were on the 3rd floor and often walked down the stairs. The location is great. There are many restaurants nearby. Times Square is less than a block away. You can walk to many attractions such as Grand Central Station, Rockefeller Center, many theaters, Times Square and the bus tours (hop on/ hop off). This is a great place to stay. We would stay here again.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4.0,"Check in / front desk":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Barbara D'Amore","date":"2012-07-21 16:45:44 +0300"},{"content":"Just came back from a long week-end in NYC. I agree with everybody. Almost everything was perfect about this hotel (location, cleanliness, friendly staff, small but workable room, decent breakfast, storage room). We got there at lunch time and our room was ready. Perfect! The only, but very important, problem is that I could hardly sleep in our room. The cause: the rooms are not soundproofed at all. We could hear the TV and the children speak in the room next to ours and everything that was going on in the hallway (a family was sharing multiple rooms and was constantly going from one room to the others, screaming, laughing and slamming doors; it was awfulâ€¦). In addition, itâ€™s New York City; people were coming in and out at all hours, slamming doors and screaming in the small hallway. I had problems falling asleep because of all the noise and was constantly waken up afterwards. In the middle of the night, after 3 or 4, I was finally able to sleep. If you are like me a light sleeper, you better select another hotel. Since we are more experienced with the subway system now, next time we plan to stay away from Times Square. For about the same price, we will get a much better hotel. We may even be ready to pay a bit more to get a good night sleep.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":2.0,"Service":4.0,"Rooms":2.0},"author":"Dr. Alford Zboncak","date":"2015-11-25 09:06:13 +0300"},{"content":"While not the swankiest hotel in the midtown area the Comfort Inn Midtown was reasonably priced (for NYC), with reasonably sized rooms (for NYC ) with friendly staff. The rooms and lobby were clean and the breakfast was adequate. However, the room was never at the right temperature and the air conditioner was very loud.
