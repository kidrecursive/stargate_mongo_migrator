Great food, friendly staff, secluded beach. Not crowded. We recommend the ocean front rooms. We could see whales from our room lanai. We got a \"romance package\" including a convertable, the breakfast buffet and a $100 dinner. Seemed reasonable...and we really e joyed ourselves. We recommend the Whale cruise that departs from the beach at the hotel. We had 25 people on a catamaran. The whales swam near the boat. We will choose the Maui Prince again.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Brendon Labadie","date":"2012-03-23 22:11:12 +0300"},{"content":"We have just rerturned from a week long trip in beautiful Maui. We stayed at the Maui Prince in Makena. We had an absolute wonderful time. The staff was very friendly and the Breakfast Buffet was wonderful. Our view from our room could of been better. But, overall it was wonderful. The beach was wonderful as well and very easy to get to.

The location in a converted historic building provides for spatial limitations clear in all areas of the hotel, but with only 57 rooms the property has almost a boutique feel to it.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
