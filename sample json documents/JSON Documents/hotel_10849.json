The staff did not give us this info, and we ended up taking the metro rail, then the suburban rail, and then realized that it's not as close (with suitcases) to walk from the train station (La Gustia... something, I forgot) like they said to us! We finally took a cab from this train station. The hotel itself was good, friendly staff, ok breakfast, clean everything. The area was good, which was an important reason for our choice. Rome city is a little far (2 city buses) though, but we were tourists anyway. They did give a ride back to that train station though.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Neva Spencer","date":"2014-03-23 15:52:23 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Dr. Liana Jenkins","Brycen Kilback","Carlo Hand","Keith Rohan I","Shanie Kirlin","Ottis Ward","Adonis Bauch DDS","Aiden Labadie","Katelin Schamberger"],"vacancy":true,"description":"The hostel is pleasant and friendly.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
