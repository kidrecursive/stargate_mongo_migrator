The experience of catching a water taxi to the steps of the hotel should be a must for all travelers (spend your euros on that rather than a gondola ride). We stayed in a standard room tucked up in the rafters and it was very comfortable and cleverly appointed to take advantage of the limited space. The view was wonderful. The tea-making facilities and desk nook were appreciated. The breakfast was delicious and the waiting staff were friendly and helpful and all spoke English. So the Ruzzini Palace gets most things right. My only quibble is that my booking supposedly included free wifi and a free welcome drink. When we arrived I had to argue with the reception staff member until he (reluctantly) agreed to let me have 24 hours free access (when we were booked in the hotel for three days). Needless to say, no free welcome drink was forthcoming. Why advertise these 'extras' if you are not going to honour them? (Free wifi really should be a standard feature of any good hotel in 2010.) I didn't need a drink and would not normally expect one but given that it was prominently advertised it made me feel peevish when it wasn't forthcoming. Perhaps we caught this staff member on a bad day or perhaps only guests staying in the superior rooms get the red carpet treatment? Despite these minor criticisms, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to other travelers. Just be ready to stand up for your entitlements.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Lorenz Rosenbaum","date":"2012-04-13 08:45:49 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed at The Ruzzini to celebrate 42 years of marriage - we couldn't have chosen a better hotel. We arrived by water taxi and were met by hotel staff at their canal entrance. We were checked in by a very friendly member of staff and shown to our Junior Suite on the first floor. A large, marble floored room with tasteful decor and twin beds pushed together as one King. Adequate bathroom (shower over bath) complete with bidet. We overlooked the quiet Campo di Santa Maria Formosa. As other reviews have mentioned, it's a wonderful tranquil area away from the hustle and bustle of St Marks and the Rialto, yet, you can be in the land of tourist groups in minutes. Our hotel 'anniversary package' meant we had a complimentary bottle of Prosecco which accompanied us on our hour long romantic gondola ride which we booked via the hotel. What we cannot emphasise enough is the wonderful staff that work on reception in The Ruzzini. Their dedication, helpfulness and friendliness to us was above and beyond any hotel staff we have ever encountered throughout the world. Mille grazie Ruzzini Hotel, especially one member of staff who seemed to be on the desk night and day throughout our 4 night stay - he even waved us goodbye as we left by water taxi, thank you very much Signor.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Nikolas Hills I","date":"2012-05-06 12:19:55 +0300"},{"content":"Ruzzini Palace is as fantastic as the other reviews have claimed. A cool haven in the bustling and jostling of Venice in July. You do need a map to get there. If you follow the instructions on their website, you can find Ruzzini Palace fairly easily. You can also pay a gondolier about 80 euros (7/10) to take you there. Simone at the front desk was really kind and helped me with a restaurant, calling a water taxi, and letting my family tour the palace (it is stunningly beautiful, with fairy glass chandeliers), even though I had checked out by the time my family showed up (we were going on a cruise, and I had come before them). The room I hadâ€”103â€”had two small balconies which overlooked a canal frequented by gondolas. Just watching the slow passage of tourists was a dream. It was a large room for one or two, with a great shower and big flat screen TV and elegant furnishings. I even took a picture of the actual floor because it was like a smooth slice of composite marble or granite with mother of pearl glinting every now and then as I walked from the closet around the room to the office space where there was a mini bar and makings for tea and coffee. The hotel was so peaceful after the mania of San Marcos Square and because I was clueless enough to haul my luggage there. Had I realized how many stair-step bridges there were, I would have paid the gondolier. I will next time. The breakfast was wonderful, and I wished that I had booked longer than one night. I plan to come back with my husband next year for our 25th wedding anniversary, because Venice is a very happy, wonderful, musical place, and I like the person I am when I'm there.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Jamal Johnston","date":"2013-06-16 16:55:38 +0300"},{"content":"My â€˜newâ€™ Husband and I stayed here as part 1 of our honeymoon tour of Italy. We arrived by water taxi from the airport and knew straight away weâ€™d booked a great place. It looks very elegant from both the canal side and the view from the campo Santa Maria Formosa in which it is located. Renovations have been sympathetic which gives this hotel a great Venetian feel. We were given an upgrade to the junior suite which had a great view of a canal from the 2 large doors that opened onto small balconies. We were also given a complimentary bottle of Prosecco which was a nice touch after such a long journey. The staff were incredibly helpful and pleasant â€“ they helped to organise a gondola trip, advised of restaurants and helped us to plan the train to part 2 of our honeymoon. The hotel is perfectly situated 5 -10 mins walk from both St Marks Square and the Rialto. Breakfast was continental with the usual additions of scrambles egg and bacon - more than enough to start the day. The only bad point is that the air con in the room was very noisy although, as we both travel often, we always take earplugs with us so it wasnâ€™t too much of an issue! In summary, there would be no reason for us to stay anywhere else if we ever visited Venice again. The perfect start to our honeymoon. A note about Venice restaurantsâ€¦.. Do your homework before you go. We stayed in Venice for 4 nights and had only 1 good meal, even given the recommendations from the hotel. Most of the restaurant and mediocre at best and are very highly priced given the quality of the food â€“ even those that are so called â€˜off the beaten trackâ€™. The only good meal we had was in the bar at the Metropole hotel â€“ a reasonably prices meal form the same kitchen as the Michelin restaurant on the top for (which Iâ€™m sure would be great but need to book up to 3 weeks in advance!). The choice was limed (only 1 main) but the food was cooked perfectly and with the aperativi and the ambiance of the Moroccan style bar, we had a great evening.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Tevin Hegmann","date":"2015-06-19 07:07:58 +0300"},{"content":"Booked 2 nights in April for surprise birthday present for Nicola, unfortunately turned out to be Easter so hotel was probably full though still felt spacious and exclusive. Location is excellent, being sufficiently removed from the thronging masses in Piazza San Marco but within easy walking distance of the main attractions of this beautifully faded city. We booked an evening in the Jazz club (well worth it!) and an evening meal at Osteria Ae Sconte (Also well worth it) through the front desk as the concierge wasn't available, but this wasn't a problem as they were attentive and very helpful. We had room 104 which was clean, cosy but comfortable, with a lovely balcony overlooking a canal, perfect for serenading passing gondoliers. Or throwing water over them..... Breakfast was included and featured a large choice of continental and hot options. Overall, an excellent hotel, expensive by global standards, though probably not by Venetian standards.....","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Otis Berge","date":"2013-11-06 04:21:58 +0300"},{"content":"Room was cozy and breakfast was good.
