The concierge and doorman were a great help too. Bourban was just around the corner and we could walk or catch the streetcar very easily from here. We were a group of 18 and the organizer got a great rate making our stay an amazing value...I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. We had lunch at Deannies kitty corner to the hotel and it was a great value... We also enjoyed the Ruby Slipper for breakfast (On Magazine St. just off Canal), a nice alternative to the IHOP down the street from the hotel.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Kaylie Gleichner","date":"2014-10-05 08:22:16 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Asa Howell","Carlie Lynch I","Domingo Adams DDS","Dudley Konopelski","Miss Abbey Schinner","Rick West","Mrs. Maryjane Haag","Ms. Davin Schroeder"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Public House, Restaurant & Guest House.
