The space is contemporary and refined, but not too overbearing. Shuâ€™s owner, Giacomino Drago, is also the familiar restaurateur and chef of several restaurants including Il Pastaio and Piccolo Paradiso in Beverly Hills. Signature dishes included halibut carpaccio with sun-dried tomato, Kobe Beef sashimi and albacore sashimi with shaved truffles.","geo":{"lat":34.12758,"lon":-118.44438,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":16674,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
