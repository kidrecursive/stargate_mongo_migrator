Though famous names like Waterford appear on the shelves, the selection emphasizes home furnishings as art, often with an elegant Asian feel.

This is the &quot;look&quot; that says one's parents and grandparents went to the right private schools. If your home looks like Gump's, you've not only &quot;arrived&quot;â€”you've been here longer than just about anyone else. As well as housewares, Gump's sells jewelry, holiday decor, and the odd bit of upscale soap.","geo":{"lat":37.7886,"lon":-122.4043,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"buy","type":"landmark","id":26184,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
