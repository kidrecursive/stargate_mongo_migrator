Both times, I have found the staff friendly, the location fantastic, and the room rate well worth it. You are literally steps from Pacific Beach (now a no-smoking, no-alcohol, no-pets beach). It's true that there is no A/C in the rooms, but we slept quite comfortably with the sliding glass door open, which allowed the ocean breeze to come through. Our room was clean, the beds and pillows were comfortable, and it was exactly the room I had requested when making my reservation. The only problem was fuzzy cable TV channels...but I'd rather watch the waves anyway.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":3.0},"author":"Mr. Jaiden Kemmer","date":"2015-03-17 00:13:43 +0300"},{"content":"After we checked into the front desk and got our luggage to go up to the room. My husband heard the staff snicker about how much luggage we had for 2 days. Not that is was their business, but the luggage was for a 10 day trip. 2 of which would be at that hotel. Which was cut down to 1 day because it was such an awful hotel. I wondered how the maid and grounds keeper knew how long we were staying anyway! If you go to this hotel, DO NOT reserve a regular room! I didn't realize the difference between a regular room and the junior suite. There is a HUGE difference, the regular room is so small that my husband hurt his back because he had to twist through the front door to get our suitcases in the room. Here was NO ROOM for our 4 SMALL pieces of luggage. We were in room 203 on the second floor. A large sized person might not make it though the door into the room! They had two beds, which looked smaller than full's, crammed into a very small space. The mattresses were set into a square pressed board, make shift frame. Which ALL of us kept hitting our toes and knees on, we ended up having to put our luggage around the corners to keep from hitting our legs, but we still kept hitting our toes. You had to squeeze past the bed to get out on the patio, the screen door may as well have not even been there, it was broken and very hard to open and close. There were only 3 towels and 1 washcloth, I had to go down to get my own towels. If you ask for towels to the pool, you have to sign a card and personally return them to the office! It didn't matter, the pool was freezing! I will say though, it is a great location, right on the beach, if you are going to stay here get a larger room!","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":1.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Heaven Kiehn","date":"2015-04-23 20:50:41 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Amely Feest"],"vacancy":false,"description":"All of the services of a hotel with the ambiance of an inn located in downtown Carmel.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
