These large images were drawn/carved/something into the ground (what is believed to be) thousands of years ago by natives. Their true meaning has never been discovered, yet they have been compared in importance, age, and curiosity with the Inca Lines in Peru. These intaglios are said to point to the north-west of California. Some speculate the drawings point to the San Francisco area, where the great Gold-Rush occurred. Some speculate the drawings are a signal to the &quot;unknown&quot; in space. Some consider this place as spiritual and religious areas. The intaglios themselves have been fenced to help preserve their lines (as they have been marred by unknowing, off-road enthusiasts). When visiting the area, remember to wear a hat and bring lots of drinking water! Also, this area of the mountains has little to no cell-phone reception.","geo":{"lat":33.800422,"lon":-114.531871,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":3780,"country":"United States","city":"Blythe","state":"California"}
