The bathroom (which I am also very particular about) was very modern, spanking clean, well provided and also had a spectacular view of the canal just like out room - which was right on the canal. The view was GREAT! The lady at the reception was very friendly and helpful; unfortunately can't say the same for the gentleman :-( The breakfast which was included was alright.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Elmore Hessel V","date":"2015-12-20 13:01:26 +0300"},{"content":"Italy being in the Euro and no longer able to devalue seems to mean that hotels in central Venice are very expensive - not even value for money when compared to Paris or London.
