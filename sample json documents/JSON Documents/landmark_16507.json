It was built in 1720 as an officer's mess for the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards and became a pub in 1818.  The pub is said to be haunted by the ghost of a junior officer who was caught cheating at cards and flogged to death.","geo":{"lat":51.5014,"lon":-0.1549,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":16507,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Grenadier%2C_Belgravia%2C_SW1_%285992985459%29.jpg"}
