The building has been a bar since 1902. Peanuts are a bonus. Friendly and efficient bar staff. Close to the hipster Bender's, so The Homestead regular crowd is a little hipster depleted / 'we got a babysitter tonight', but all in all a great bunch. It's rumored to have had a brothel during prohibition.","geo":{"lat":37.7604,"lon":-122.4146,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":25916,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
