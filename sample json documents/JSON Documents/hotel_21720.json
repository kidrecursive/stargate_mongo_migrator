In the short time since our previous visit I was disappointed and dismayed to find how much the Resort has slipped in its appearance and performance. Housekeeping is truly less that thorough with dirty bathroom floors, furniture surfaces left soiled and unclean. The rooms are showing their age in terms of dinged and damaged furnishings, broken lamp shades. chips on walls and scratched, soiled painted surfaces. Cupboards not closing properly and calls for repairs unanswered. We even left the \"repair card\" which is deposited in each room by the staff to notify them of any problems and this was never tended to nor answered. The breakfast buffet has simply lost its quality and execution. Most foods tasted bland and were either under/overcooked. Mediocre at best considering the hi price you pair for breakfast each morning in the Grand Dining Room. My biggest grip and huge shock was to see the mistreatment and disregard for guests at the main pool area (adult). 14-16 casabellas each morning with eight louge chairs a piece usurped by the staff with white towels as \"reserved for paying guests\" . Well at $1000 a day it was no surprise that only 2-3 three of these casabellas were ever rented during our week stay. This in turn left approx 96 poolside chairs unavailable to the rest of the guests who were inconvenienced and displaced out onto the lawn when the few chairs that remained poolside were grabbed up by guests as early as 7a.m. Not a person in sight to assist guests when they had to shuttle chairs out onto the lawn since nothing was left poolside and again only 2-3 casabellas occupied with 8 chairs each UNUSED. This is ridiculous and a slap in the face to paying guests who are already shelling out a minimum of $500/nite to stay here. 96 chairs left unusable ALL DAY LONG just in case someone MIGHT rent them and NO ONE did. This is completely unacceptable, bad business and the poorest way to treat guests. We all understand the economy is bad, but should paying guests be put out, put off and displaced by the uncertain hope/wish that maybe just MAYBE someone will rent a casabella and take the 8 chairs, or should they make a policy that unless one is reserved by the night before or 9a.m. that morning the rest should be left open and the 8 chairs they contain available to all guests . This has left a huge distaste in my mind and feeling that we will not be returning let alone recommending others to visit. Its a shame, the place was once magnificent and held it guests with the highest regard, always very accomodating and offering to make you comfortable. This seems to have disappeared.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":2.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Anissa Kilback","date":"2014-06-27 23:30:09 +0300"},{"content":"I was there in Grand Wailea for 4 days during second week of June.

That was a discount from the regular $545 rate. The room was a nice room. But, I guess I expected to be wowed given the status of the Grand Wailea as *the* resort in Maui. The staff is incredible! The grounds are lush. The pool are clean and refreshing. There are separate areas for kids and adults. The beach is groomed each morning. Snorkeling right off the beach is enjoyable. But try to bring your own snorkel gear as itâ€™s $12/ day to rent it. Which brings me to the point of my review: paying for everything. WOW, the prices. Rum & Coke, $12. Mai Tai, $14. Bottled water, $5. Soda, $6.50. Hamburger w/ fries, $22. Cabanas, $300 for half day. Valet, $25/ day (no more free parking). Spa, $250 entry/access fee before you start picking treatments. Yes, I understand that itâ€™s not an all-inclusive. But after staying at Sandals and Beaches, we paid less than at Grand Wailea. I know this review goes against the grain of most reviews. But, after the flight and all the expense to stay at the resort, I guess I expected a little more for a little less. If you stay at the Grand Wailea, I do believe you WILL enjoy yourself â€“ we certainly did. But, the checkout bill will hurt.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Noe Kemmer","date":"2014-03-08 22:23:35 +0300"},{"content":"Front Office staff, managers were very rude and uncordial. Complaints in regards to my bill was directed to accounting staff where only rude employees again that did not care of the amount of money I was putting into their pockets. NO ALOHA spirit at all. As I walked the grounds and lobby I saw employees from Front Office DRESSED in their white nurse looking uniform shopping and purchasing food. Very unprofessional to pay and be charged so much and I had to stand in line again with the same rude people to purchase a meal for my family. Very dissatisfied and not a fan of feeling like I didn't matter or that i was replaceable. Management should keep employees out of site and away IN UNIFORM. Ununiformed employees were also noticeable for they were openly speaking of their 30% employee discount that I was not granted and eligible for. Employees walking around laughing and giggling of the people over paying for rooms they pay $150 for...NO PROFESSIONALISM AT ALL! I will NOT be returning to this UNgrand hotel. I will stay at the Ritz or Four Seasons where I am welcomed and treated as an guest with ALOHA.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":1.0},"author":"Jairo O'Kon","date":"2012-06-02 08:36:45 +0300"},{"content":"Great hotel.

Great pools, restaruants, etc although really not the type of resort I would enjoy if it were just my wife and I. Highly recommend the Napua tower and the excellent breakfast and drinks that are included daily. The staff up there were phenomenal. The Breakfast buffett was just so-so, recommend going to the Four Seasons if you enjoy a good breakfast. Service at the pool leaves a lot to be desired, dont expect any special treatment if you splurge for an overpriced cabana. Free high speed internet is appreciated.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Service":3.0},"author":"Idella Hermiston I","date":"2015-03-13 18:40:10 +0300"},{"content":"Check in was smooth with an easy registration and the bellman ready to go with our luggage. Overall, the facility was very nice. We didn't eat on-site as we were already familiar with the area and had a car. The pool scene is a bit of a zoo and hard to enjoy. People would stake out their chairs at dawn and there was no place to sit by noon. The water park is the big draw, and it was fun, but the thrill wore off quickly for our teenagers. We had stayed next door at the Wailea Beach Villas. There was no comparison.
