Our very first impression as we drove in to the resort was that this was going to be a perfect honeymoon. The drive in to the resort is beautiful, especially at night with all of the Tiki torches lit. We were promptly greeted by the valet and escorted to the check-in desk and we were offered a free upgrade, as promised, but we were a bit disappointed that we were only offered a room with 2 double beds instead of a king - especially since the resort appeared to be extremely vacant. The room was as we expected, but it was not perfectly clean. The balconies looked as though they had not been washed in several months and the shower had mold along the grout lines where the grout met the glass. The landscaping of the resort was impeccable, but unfortunately that was not shared by the rest of the amenities. The common area hallways were not very clean and the upkeep was not spectacular. You don't need to look far to see areas that need improvement. Lot's of painting, cleaning, and repairs need to be made to get this hotel to what should be Waldorf-Astoria standards. One day I removed my plastic bracelet (Daily plastic bracelets must be worn to access the pool and beach areas) and placed it on a table near the elevator. Two days later when we checked out it was still there! This should give you some idea of the lack of attention to detail. I would guess that no less than 100 employees walked by that bracelet during those 2 days. The food at the Grand Wailea was spectacular, and overall the service was good. Our highlights include the service at the swim-up pool bar as provided by Wayne and Richard. Our waiter, Justin, at HumuHumu was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Some of the disappointments were the service at the breakfast restaurant, the Grand Dining Room. They must expect most customers to eat the Buffet so that they can serve theirselves, because the service was almost non-existent. We ate here three times and had hrrible service all three times. On our third visit, we decided to time how long it took before we were greeted by our server. It took 12 minutes, followed by another 9 minutes just to get coffee! We did complain to the hotel manager who put us in touch with the Food & Beverage Manager and the charges for two of the meals were reversed. Service by the adult pool was also very poor. We did see servers, but nobody ever stopped by to take our drink orders despite our attempts to wave their attention. We had to go inside the poolside restaurant to get our own drinks. The activities at the GW and in Maui are great. I am a certified diver, but my wife is not. She took a 45 minute course at the resort which consisted of a 20 minute lecture followed by a dive in their own dive pool. We were then both take to a beach dive right at the resort that had some reef and sea life. Our instructor/guide, Eric, was excellent. He was very friendly and we found sea turtles and a small octopus that we actually held in our hands while he took underwater photography. The concierge was also excellent. You MUST take advantage of the concierge. They will build you a whole itinerary for your visit and have relationships to book all of the non-resort activities on your behalf and have them billed to your room. We took a helicoptor tour of West Maui and Molokini with Sunshine helicoptors. They are the only provider that will guarantee front row seating for two for a small premium upgrade. The tour was good - not great, though that was no fault of the tour guide. It's just unfortunate that there are no active volcanoes to see in Maui. We also took a snorkel/snuba tour on a powered twin-hull catamaran out of Maalea Harbour. We dove at two locations Molokini Crater and another \"unknown\" location that was know to have lots of turtles. The crater was decent, but if you have any experience scuba diving, then this will not live up to your expectations. We happened to be out on a very windy and wavey day, so the snorkeling was difficult for most of the inexperienced snorkel, snuba divers (Snuba is a hybrid of snorkeling and scuba that allows you to breathe up to 20 feet underwater via a hose and air tank that floats on the surface). The highlight of this tour was having about 20 spinner dolphins swim with the boat as we cruised at slow speed between dives. The burgers that they cook right on board between dives were also pretty tasty! We did a zipline tour in Kaanapali that wes pretty good. Not as scarey as the ziplining in Costa Rica, but that's a good thing for most people. It seems much safer and has very large landing platforms so there is no fear of making any mistakes. In fact, they make it foolproof and the scenery is of course spectacular. The highlight of our activities was the drive to Hana. The drive is simply breathtaking through lush, tropical landscape along the most winding road you will ever travel! I recommend going on a day that has forecasted some rain or had rain the night before. The dozens of waterfalls that we saw along the way were extremely active due to all the rainfall they had up the mountain. Don't worry - it doesn't ever seem to rain in Wailea despite the forecast. Wailea gets 16\" of rain a year while it rains over 350\" just 10 miles away! It's the strangest thing - but very cool! The concierge will provide you a list of the best places to stop along the way to swim in waterholes and waterfalls, eat banana bread, buy local art, have a scenic lunch, etc. Do not miss out on this excursion! It takes a full day, but I found it far more exhilerating than the helicoptor tour. We drove back the same way we came up, though you can go all the way around the mountain. My wife had a videcamera but was afraid to let go of the dashboard because of my speeding down the roads! For driving enthusiasts that like to go fast, this is as good as it gets. By fast I mean a top speed of maybe 30 MPH. This road has over 600 turns where you turn the wheel greater than 45 degrees. I hope Playstation has this road on one of their driving games because I'm buying it! Other recommendations for food include Mama's Fish House for dinner. It's about a 30 minute drive from the resort, but it's very charming and the food is delicious. Everyone that you talk to will tell you to go here. We also had great meals at Duo and Spago next door at the Four Seasons. Overall, we had a wonderful trip. We had some disappointments with the resort that we did not expect to have when spending that kind of money. Plan to spend a lot of money! We averaged about $750 a day for 2 people, not including the cost of the room. The activities will run about $300 for ziplining to over $800 for the helicoptor tour. When you add that to $200+ dinners and lunch and drinks by the pool, you will see how it quickly adds up.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Rusty Turcotte","date":"2014-09-12 23:05:11 +0300"},{"content":"My husband won a President's Award, which was the only reason we stayed at such an upscale resort. Usually when we travel, we choose modest accomodations so we can splurge on activities and meals. The size of the resort is almost overwhelming, but is nicely landscaped and decorated with fine art, and the room was quite spacious. The food was a different story. We were both rather disappointed that the quality wasn't better for the price. I've grilled better steak at home and the cocktails were less than impressive. Some people commented here that the spa was dirty. I completely disagree. I thought the spa was fantastic. Although the price tag was a bit steep, the baths were heavenly and the free scrub was an added bonus. I choose a traditional swedish massage, and my massage therapist, Roxanne, did an amazing job! It was quite an experience. If we were to go back to Maui, my husband and I would probably just stay at the Days Inn for $90 per night.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Xander Grimes","date":"2013-01-02 11:33:01 +0300"},{"content":"Last week my husband and I stayed at the Grand Wailea in the Napua Tower for the second time this year. This trip like many others, we had the opportunity to stay next door at the Four Seasons but instead chose to stay at the Grand Wailea mostly because of the staff at the hotel, especially in the Napua Tower. The staff in the Napua tower provides such great attention to detail and service and the fact that they remember us from previous trips and call us by name makes us feel very special not to mention at home.

That can be good and bad. But when it comes superior customer service, the Concierge at Napua Tower have been consistently exceptional. In particular, Jerry Fournier, the Napua Suite Liaison, has always helped us manage the vacation process before we arrive as well as coordinate plans during our stay. He's a go-to type of person that gets tasks done. Clearly it's a challenge keeping everyone happy simultaneously, but Jerry and his team just find a way to make it happen ! I do spend my fair share of time travelling for business, usually to Asia from the US's east coast multiple times a year. I am quite familiar with good service and few hotels in the US match up to their Asian counterparts. The Napua team is the closest I've seen to that type of service. For me to write something like this is rare indeed. But when someone like Jerry (and I'm sure there are more on the GWR staff) does his job everyday as an unsung hero of the resort, it merits special attention.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Norma Conn Jr.","date":"2013-11-30 23:50:55 +0300"},{"content":"We are checking out of the Grand Wailea today and we are really happy to be getting out of here. We've been in Maui for about ten days for our honeymoon and have been staying at a few places including the Ritz Carlton, the Hotel Hana and the Grand Wailea. The Grand Wailea has been a HUGE disappointment. The service is lackluster at best and the entire place is packed with people. There is nothing relaxing about being here- it has the feel of an overpacked cruise ship. The grounds were supposed to be luxurious but are actually pretty tacky. There are ads everywhere for everything from vow renewals to property ownership and the whole place is just a tourist trap nightmare. My husband and I booked a spa treatment at the spa hoping that it would be a nice retreat but it was just more overpriced tourist fodder. The hydrotherapy room was so packed with people that it just seemed gross to be jumping in and out of the pools- you couldn't get any room to yourself. The service at the spa was not good, the whole place is much more hype than reality. At the end of the day we spent over $800 on spa treatments today and if I had to do it over again I wouldn't have done it. Moral of the story- this place is not at all worth it. We had heard that from some of the reviews on TripAdvisor and didn't listen and we couldn't regret it more. We made the mistake of pre-paying for our room and we were so disappointed when we arrived that we tried to cancel and go somewhere else but due to prepaying didn't have the flexibility to do so. If we could have left the day we checked in we absolutely would have.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Location":1.0,"Rooms":1.0},"author":"Irwin O'Connell","date":"2014-02-09 01:16:23 +0300"},{"content":"Stayed at this hotel on a business conference but had a lot of time for personal fun. The Good: The facility is beautiful and the beach is beautiful. Everything is well kept and very nice. Room service did a great job every day. We didn't have kids with us so we spent a decent amount of time at the adult pool area. It's a nice pool with a big lawn you can hang out. We really enjoyed the peace and quiet. The beach is open to the public but not too many people outside the resort go there. You can swim in the water and the current is not bad at all. The staff seemed nice and we had good service from just about everyone. Valet parking for the day is free but you pay a lot to stay overnight. The Bad: As with everything in Hawaii the food and beverages at the hotel are very expensive. We bought a styrofoam cooler and some beer and wine at the Wal Mart and kept this in our room. We still ate and drank at the hotel but having our little cooler was a nice break from $10+ drinks. Overnight valet parking is very expensive so we parked in the free lot on the other side of the resort. It's first come first serve and fills up at night so get there early if you want a spot. There are some rooms that are newly renovated and others that are not. We were originally put in a newly renovated room but it had two beds. When they moved us to a room with one bed it was the older room. Bummer. It was nice but not as nice as the other. We didn't pay for our room (paid for by corporate) but when I compared the cost of this hotel vs. other comparable hotels it seemed a little pricey for what you get. I think this is because of the sweet beach location. We would consider returning in spite of this. Especially if we bring kids. The best part of our trip was renting a Harley for the day and cruising the island. Definitely one of the most memorable times of my life. Sorry if my review wasn't very thorough but we spent a lot of time either playing offsite or at organized social functions revolved around business. The functions were great and a lot of fun but it didn't give us a lot of time to really get a feel for everything at the resort.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Bret Wiegand","date":"2015-03-13 17:19:56 +0300"},{"content":"My husband and I stayed at Grand Wailea for our week-long vacation in Maui. We both work in the industry, and have high expectations. Grad Wailea blew us away! It was by far the best hotel on the island. The open-air lobby, friendly staff, and amazing views from the room, along with the most fun pool (all the pools are connected by water slides) and beach made our stay extremely memorable and fun. It's about 30 mintes from the airport - if you are renting a car, we STRONGLY recommend bringing a GPS to get around - it was incredibly useful to us. The room was spacious (we had a suite on the eighth floor) with three balconies. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom amenities - Honey Mango - are the best we've had!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Tia Wuckert","date":"2013-10-02 01:44:55 +0300"},{"content":"This was my 3rd trip to Hawaii, but my first time on Maui, so I decided to splurge and stay at the Grand Wailea. First impressions are important and this hotel did not dissapoint. This is a very well maintained with a very attentive staff. The grounds are beautiful, if not a bit large. Unlike some other hotels in Wailea, this one is located right on the beach, with plenty of attendants to help set up beach chairs, umbrellas and the sort. The weekend I was there happened to be fairly quiet, so there were no issues finding a good spot on the beach, by the pool, etc. I can forsee how crowded the pools and beach can get during high season though. The restaurant choices were pretty good, albeit a little on the expensive side, but about on-par with what you'd expect from an upscale resort like this one. One thing I would like to spotlight is their Spa. This is probably one of the better spas I've been to, with a great staff, great treatment options, and excellent terme.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Jordan Schiller","date":"2014-12-07 07:21:26 +0300"},{"content":"My husband and I stayed at the Grand Wailea recently and couldn't have asked for a more perfect experience.
