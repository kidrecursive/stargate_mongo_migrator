Walking into the park and through a small tunnel beneath the Alvord Lake Bridge, the first large field and adjacent hill are known as Hippie Hill. In dry weather, Hippie Hill is a popular destination for locals and offers a glimpse at the Haight's hippie culture.  There visitors will find a large and popular drum circle, amateur performers of many types from jugglers to musicians, frisbee enthusiasts, picnickers, and psychedelic drug users, all mingling happily.  Don't be surprised to find locals lighting up a joint of marijuana at Hippie Hill.  Though marijuana use is still illegal in the US, California has decriminalized medical marijuana.  A note from your doctor suffices to obtain a card enabling one to reliably check quantity and quality and purchase in a civilized manner over a counter.  Hippie Hill is a relatively safe place to purchase marijuana, but law enforcement patrols Haight Street at the urging of merchants in order to maintain a teen- and tourist-friendly environment.","geo":{"lat":37.7692,"lon":-122.4543,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25815,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
