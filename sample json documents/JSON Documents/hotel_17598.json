Very convenient location, lovely room, and excellent friendly staff. The onsite restaurant Sazerac is to die for, and has a marvelous happy hour! The hotel hosts a \"wine hour\" at the end of the day, and this was a great way to relax and meet other guests. They will give you a goldfish in a bowl for your room, during your stay, if you request it. I thought that was a really fun twist. I would highly recommend this hotel, and would LOVE to stay there again!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Ms. Arielle Rosenbaum","date":"2012-09-11 15:16:46 +0300"},{"content":"We couldn't say enough about our stay at this hotel. Our kids loved it! The goldfish in the room was a big hit, as were the free milk and cookies, free toy chest, and free movie! They got a kick out of the animal print bathrobes. While not being a \"kid hotel\", they make kids feel very special. From an adult perspective, the lobby is beautiful, the rooms are nicely done and clean, the staff is great, the complimentary wine hour is a nice touch, the attached restaurant was great, and the location is awesome. Bravo--Kimpton has figured it out!","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Michaela Rau","date":"2013-04-17 02:39:03 +0300"},{"content":"Love this hotel for business or personal travel. They had to replace the phone in my room and delivered a box of chocolates to apologize. Also love that Kimpton in touch program gives you a $10 minibar credit and free wifi.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Jasper Runte","date":"2012-12-16 00:44:07 +0300"},{"content":"This was a lovely hotel and the front desk staff were very welcoming and informative.
