We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay the week. Everything about the place was fantastic, infact it is hard to put how awesome the place was into words. The pricing couldn't be beat for starters. More importantly, the cleanliness, the spaciousness, decorating were all impeccable. We would recommend this resort to all family and friends. Anthony took excellent care of our details prior to arrival and per his email regarding the front gate and the keyless entry, everything went as smoothly as it possible could. We enjoyed the Condo's amenities, including pool, clubhouse, and gym. We used the laundry machine located in the condo everyday. The only dirty clothes we took home were the ones we drove home in. Thats the perfect way to end a vacation, no dirty clothes to deal with at home. We spent hours looking for the right condo on VRBO and other rental websites When we found the Go Disney Vacation website, we hit the jackpot!! Anthony will definitely have our repeat business. Regarding the pricing, we could stay on Disney property, but the outrageous cost for Disney is not worth it. We had our own quiet jungle to retreat to each night. I've stayed in the Contemporary, Poly, and Port Orleans, hands down, including the bus service Disney offers, this place is in a league of its own. One that is much, much better. Thanks Anthony!

We felt very comfortable staying there since it felt like home. It was beautifully furnished and done very tasteful. My children liked the bedroom with their own private TV and DVD along with the movies and games. Go Disney Vacation explained everything to us in detail regarding the condo and everything was just as they described it to be. I loved the fact that it was in a gated community and the key pad code to the front door was an excellent idea. What a wonderful trip. One thing I wished we could have changed was the duration of the stay. Two weeks was too short. Next time we will be looking into a longer stay. Thanks to everyone especially Go Disney Vacation!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Breanne Bogan","date":"2014-07-13 14:18:19 +0300"},{"content":"Excellent Service, best location There are three Macro Polo Hotels in Canton Road. I stayed in Macro Polo Prince before. I preferred Macro Polo Gateway. Gateway is located in the middle and it has the best location. It is only within 5-minutes walking distance to the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR (subway) station. It is next to the upscale shopping center 鈥?Harbor City.  Hotel鈥檚 staff was excellent. Service was good. I was sick and I called the hotel desk for help. The hotel staff was so kind and he walked me to a nearby doctor.The hotel room was kind of outdated, and you would have 鈥渞eal key鈥?instead of access card. Closet in the room was not functioning at all. I could not even open it. I would say that the room was quite small and it would need renovation. However, it was clean.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Eloise Aufderhar","date":"2014-02-23 07:15:05 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed in this hotel in July 2011. The hotel gave an impression as if you are living in your own small apartment in Venice. We booked a transfer from the airport to the hotel, which was very convenient. We really liked the modern design of our room. The room (â€œcharmingâ€�) was equipped with all the necessary staff - bathrobe, slipper, coffe machine, tea and kettle, repellent. The room \"charming'\" fits for two persons only. The location was really nice and central (10 min to San Marko). Would be nice to stay there again.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":4.0},"author":"Alize Pagac","date":"2014-11-02 23:11:10 +0300"},{"content":"I have stayed in Venice 3 times prior to this visit, including a stay on the Lido and a week at the Danielli. Venice is truly one of the unique places in the world to visit and most of its hotels are unique as well. The general rule for the upper end Venice hotels is pretty expensive, good service, dramatic facades and lobbies, followed by individual rooms that are small, dated and quite uninspiring. The Charming House IQ truly breaks this mold. The unmarked entrance off the canal is picture book, opening to a small lobby. There is no grand lobby or public area. Guests are given a set of keys to the iron gate fronting the piazza and the heavy wooden unmarked door which opens to a private courtyard. We had a two room suite with 2 in each room and a private entry to each room. The larger room contained a small kitchen area and a full sized living room. Sharing this space was the best of all worlds. Furnishings were urban upscale (think W hotel) as a opposed to old and stuffy. Rooms and the bathrooms are huge by Venice standards. The staff was fabulous. Extremely helpful. They set the table each morning in our living room and catered in a nice continental breakfast and brought ice for evening drinks. The lobby is not staffed all day - they are there from 8 -12 and then 5:30 -8. As there are only a small number of rooms, this is all that is needed. We were provided with directions and recommendations for cool spots based on our tastes. I feel we are now friends with the staff. Much more fun than dealing with a snooty concierge. We have a new home in Venice!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Mafalda Hintz","date":"2012-10-01 00:57:36 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Shyanne Hyatt","Raegan Harris IV","Darrion Bogisich"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Comfortable and traditional style inn with a quiet B&B atmosphere.
