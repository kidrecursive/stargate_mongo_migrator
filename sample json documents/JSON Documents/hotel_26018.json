The food at the restaurant on site was excellent along with the room service. Our children loved the glass bottom pool and it was nice to have a staff member who sat right beside the pool and watched all of the children. We had a suite which was very comfortable. My only comment would be there was no bathtub in our suite.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Brycen Mosciski","date":"2014-06-04 00:31:21 +0300"},{"content":"Traveled with 2 family members including a teenager on her first international trip. I chose the Westin based on its location and our longstanding experience staying at the chain in the States. We were pleased with the choice. The hotel is excellently located. We walked to everything except the botanical gardens/olympic stadium. For those who prefer to ride, the metro is approximately one block away. We seldom dined in the hotel - only breakfast and dessert - because of numerous dining options in the surrounding areas. However, the food was good with a well-stocked buffet option and the service attentive. The room was clean and large enough to accomodate 2 adults and a teen without our stepping on and over one another. Housekeeping staff responded quickly to requests. While there is nothing spectacular about the hotel, it fit our family's needs on this trip to a tee and sometimes that's enough.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Sophie Kris","date":"2013-07-14 22:22:24 +0300"},{"content":"Just came back from a 3 day weekend in Montreal. I really enjoyed this hotel. It is a brand new hotel and the location, rooms, service, and food were all excellent. The hotel is located within walking distance of the Old Town and also near a Metro station. The Montreal Metro is awesome and efficient so we were able to go anywhere in the city within a matter of minutes. The rooms in the new tower were quiet and clean. The bathroom was really nice with granite counter tops and the shower was a nice size. Everything else was typical Westin quality. The best part is that high speed internet was included in the room rate. This is not the case for most Westins I've stayed at. The only complaint I had was that housekeeping came really late, sometimes after 4:00pm. We sometimes came back to nap during that time, so that got somewhat tricky. Also, housekeeping didn't replace the shampoo or bar soaps. I know they are trying to cut down on waste, but if we have empty shampoo bottles in the shower, they should be replaced. Our rate included buffet breakfast in the restaurant. It was really delicious and there were a lot of choices. The staff was also very friendly. They were all bilingual, so our party not being able to speak French was not a problem. All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel. It has everything you expect from a Westin and more.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Joesph O'Reilly","date":"2015-10-17 03:26:56 +0300"},{"content":"We were very pleased with our stay at Le Westin. We had a traditional room, which was modern and large. The King size bed was really comfortable. The bathroom was also a nice size, although we did run into some plumbing problems. The shower would not drain. Someone had to come fix it twiceâ€¦and it still did not drain well. The hotel amenities were great. Everything is brand new. Very nice pools, and the workout room was spectacular. The hotel has free wifi, and allows you to print out boarding passes for free ( i read about this being a problem at other hotels). The entire staff was friendly and professional. The concierge was very helpful. We liked the location as it boarders old Montreal and is a few blocks from a subway. Breakfast buffet was 18-21$ per person (we did not have it included in our package). We had it once and I really donâ€™t think it was worth it. Quantity was there, but the quality of the food was lacking. I never stayed in a Westin before, and would certainly not hesitate to do so after such a wonderful stay here.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Caden Schumm PhD","date":"2015-04-08 09:10:01 +0300"},{"content":"Nice property.
