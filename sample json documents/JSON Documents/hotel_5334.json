Well - we had the room next to us in major partying so I ended up calling the front desk at 4am and they called security to quiten them down. Then the next night we were kept up the entire night with the party going on around the pool – now we were won the 56 th floor so that was loud music! Since staying there I have read a similar review so the hotel are well aware that the party by the pool is very disruptive but still allow it to go on! They sell themselves as a high end sophisticated hotel but there are huge flaws in the Encore experience!","ratings":{"Overall":2.0},"author":"Maurice Orn","date":"2012-10-30 15:47:00 +0300"},{"content":"Gal's get-away weekend! Encore was very nice. Concierge staff very helpful. We had beautiful and large adjoining rooms so it was PERFECT for 6 of us. Nice L shaped sofa in each room & bathrooms very well appointed. BEAUTIFUL view of golf course and \"the strip\".One bummer--no coffee maker in rooms or anywhere in lobby, etc. Had to go out & bring it back (found some for sale in the small cafe in the workout room)...got room service once but it was very expensive. Loved eating at La Cave and also at Wazuzu. Work out room OK. Spa looked beautiful but we didn't utilize. IF you reserve a car, make sure you find out if it will be at Encore or Wynn. I reserved a car at (what I thought) was Encore, waited in a long line only to find out that my car was at Wynn.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Vilma Funk","date":"2014-11-13 07:03:05 +0300"},{"content":"We are a couple in our late 20's early 30's who stayed at Encore in September 2011 for a week for our honeymoon in a standard Resort Suite. We requested a strip view room on check-in and got a room on the 30th floor (I think). Due to the curve of the building our room was the closest to the strip in the Resort side of the floor and we had a fantastic view down the strip including Treasure Island, Mirage and Caesars. We could watch the Mirage volcano from our room. The room was large with a comfortable couch and lovely bed. The bathroom was enormous. The pool was pretty quiet but had excellent service with waitresses constantly coming around with complimentary fruit bowls and taking drinks orders. Service was excellent and all members of staff that we dealt with, from receptionists to dealers to cleaners were all very friendly. We got turn-down service one night even though we didnt request it and then someone else tried to do it on the same night!! The room was cleaned everyday and all common areas of the hotel were very clean at all times. The casino is fairly small and quiet compared to some other resorts but the dealers were excellent. The casino is also pretty light which is a nice change from some of the dark ones elsewhere on the strip. The hotel is located to the north of the strip next door to Wynn across from Fashion Show Mall and close to Venetian/Palazzo, Treasure Island and Mirage. We had no issues with the location and could comfortably walk anywhere that we wanted to go on the strip. Although we could hear the bass from the Beach Club it didnt prevent us from sleeping at all. This hotel is easily the best hotel that I have ever stayed in and would gladly recommend it to anyone visiting Las Vegas.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Nicola Keeling","date":"2013-10-21 03:18:04 +0300"},{"content":"Everything is perfect, what you should expect from Vegas. A little expensive compared to other hotels, but it is worth it. Amazing views, ambiance is a little high end, high rollers and no young crowd, since tables are more expensive. But this place is and has the best of the best.

Usually stay at the Wynn but the prices for the Encore were much better and I like that the casino is much quieter there. Going to bed the first night at 1 AM I could hear people partying in the next room loudly, eventually they quieted or went out for the night. The sound seemed to come through the windows room to room on the 60-something floor and it was nothing I had experienced at any other Vegas hotel. At 7 AM the room that backed up to my bed (a different room) was blasting electronic dance music that I thought I was at a rave. The people were screaming and dancing and jumping on the beds. I called hotel security who quieted them briefly before they started up again. I called to complain again and was told my the operator that this is Vegas and I should expect noise. Yeah, maybe in the hallway baby, not a crackhead rave party in my room, especially not at that hour! Later that day I went to the front desk and my room was moved. First of all, the Encore is a nice, high-end hotel (for Vegas). I expect both higher-end guests and higher-end treatment. Secondly, I don't understand why I had to be inconvenienced and move when the guests on both sides of my room where clearly inappropriate. For this inconvenience the hotel gave me a $75 credit, they should've comped the room for the night or at the very least given a major upgrade when I moved. The reason I am giving the hotel 4 instead of 3 stars is that all the restaurants serve Vegan food which is delicious and a treat when you can get it without complaint in high-end restaurants. Also, the hotel and the hotel rooms are very nice. However, the management staff has a lot to learn about treating clients.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":1.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Thurman Konopelski","date":"2015-03-20 10:06:22 +0300"},{"content":"Great hotel with great amenities. Stayed here fore three nights and enjoyed every one. The hotel is beautiful and staff was great. The room was spacious and had a great view of the strip. The hotel and casino were nice however I preferred gambling at the Wynn. Wife went to their spa and enjoyed her visit. Fantastic buffet at the Wynn...best on the strip. Wish this was located more centrally on the strip however would definitely love stay again.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Marley Wuckert","date":"2015-08-18 11:21:12 +0300"},{"content":"I didn't stay at this hotel but I passed through here to check it out. I met up with some friends here and a VERY RUDE employee of Encore just blatantly yelled at us, \"MOVE IT! YOU CAN'T STAND HERE\" WOW seriously!? This experience represented your property terribly. Why would you hire such rude employees in the hotel business?! What ever happened to \"customers first\" in the hospitality industry?! There's a much more appropriate way to tell people that they can't stand somewhere, Encore and that is \"Excuse me miss, sorry but people aren't allowed to stand here because ____.\" I was seriously so shocked I didn't know how to react to that employee. A bit of advice Encore, work on customer service if you want to be top in the hospitality industry. Highly doubt I would ever want to stay at this hotel.","ratings":{"Overall":1.0,"Service":1.0},"author":"Luna Grady","date":"2013-03-01 21:24:46 +0300"},{"content":"This was our 3rd stay at the Encore over the last few years and sadly our last. What was once a clean, sleek room overlooking the strip is now tired and with major signs of neglect. Our bathroom had some kind of fecal material on the wall. When we brought this to the attention of the conceirge they assured us someone would be up to clean the room properly. Sadly in our 3 day stay this problem ( everytime you used the bathroom it was there stairing you in the face) was never addressed. So I guess Steve Wynn really doesn't give a poop. Ps the food by the pool is really terrible.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":1.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Dr. Rowland Hammes","date":"2013-08-13 03:36:26 +0300"},{"content":"We just came back from our trip to Las Vegas. We loved the Encore!!! The hotel was so clean, the service was very personable. It wasn't crowded and smoky in the casino like the other hotels. The dining at both Encore and Wynn was exceptional. It may be a bit more pricey than the other hotels, but it was definitely worth it. If you want a clean upscale hotel then look no further.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Jabari McLaughlin","date":"2014-02-20 01:09:47 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Mr. Thea Harris","Mrs. Mireille Dare","Mafalda Corkery","Shayne Schmitt PhD"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Catered chalet accommodation in a beautiful chalet close to the centre of Chamonix.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
