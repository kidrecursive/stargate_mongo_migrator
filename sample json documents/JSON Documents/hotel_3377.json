The room was quiet and clean. That's the only positive. The concierge was horribly uninformed in every way. The front desk was unresponsive. The lobby is sterile and noisy. The bed was way too soft. There are no safes in the rooms. The sauna was out of order and the locker room needs an immediate overhaul. The food in the restaurant is below average. The place gives a general impression that no one is in charge. We were charged for items in the minibar that we never consumed. Extra cost for wifi. And apparently they treat their employees badly. There were pickets outside. 4 Star? No way.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":2.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Rickey Erdman","date":"2012-05-13 04:56:21 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed here for business. It was in a great location, close to the theater district, shopping, etc. There is only one restaurant and a very small bar in the hotel. It would have been nice to have additional options. There were restaurants close by, but again, it would have been nice to have had the convenience of additional dining places. The fitness center was so so. I was very disappointed that there was a charge for internet. When paying the price we paid per night, that should have been included in the room cost. Great concierges.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Denis Moore","date":"2013-10-03 21:43:09 +0300"},{"content":"I'm a Bostonian, and I've had to find a hotel to live in while my home is being renovated. I needed a hotel I could stay in long term, so I stayed in a few different hotels until I found one that could make me feel comfortable, like home. This hotel had the worst service of all the Boston hotels I tried in that time period. The day I arrived, my companion and I were tired, so we decided to have a little bit to eat and some drinks in their restaurant, I can't remember the name, but it's the one by the lobby. The service was miserably sad. The hostess, who was holding menus, asked if we were here for dinner. I said yes. She told us to seat ourselves and never gave us menus. I thought she might follow behind us with menus, but they never came until we requested them. The service was incredibly slow even though the restaurant was mostly empty. It took us 20 minutes just to get water and we only received it after we asked for it. The drinks took nearly 30 minutes to arrive. I watched two people hold our meals and look around at tables for at least 10 minutes. They put the meals down, walked away, walked back, looked at tables, looked at the computer. I tried to make eye contact, and indicate that they were looking for my table, but it was useless. The food eventually made it to my table cold. I knew we couldn't expect to keep drinking at this place, and we were too tired to find someplace else on a Friday night, so I decided to go to the room, and invite a few friends over for drinks. I thought just one friend was coming, so I ordered 2 bottles of cava and 3 glasses. My friend called, and said she would bring her boyfriend, so I called room service back to see if I could add an additional glass to my order. I was told that it had not left yet, so the extra glass would be added. About 15 minutes later, my cava arrived with only 3 glasses. The person who brought it said that she would be right back because she forgot a wine bottle opener. I told her we don't need a wine bottle opener for cava, but that we had ordered 1 extra glass. She told me she would bring it right up. My friends arrived and started drinking. Over 20 minutes later, I still had no fourth glass. I called room service, who told me it would be there right away. 15 minutes later, I still had no glass. I called guest services, who told me they would send me a glass. 15 minutes later, there was no glass. I called the night manager, who told me they would send a glass. 15 minutes later, after an entire bottle was finished, a man knocked on my door, shoved a glass into my hand so quickly that I almost didn't catch it, and took off without a smile or even a glance in my direction. I called the night manager to say that it had arrived, but that I was entirely disappointed with the service this evening. The manager said that there was nothing she could do, but that she would have someone call me and apologize the next day. I never received any sort of apology for this horrible evening. The next morning, I had forgotten to put the privacy sign on the door, so when housekeeping came around and knocked, it was no surprise. We were already up and getting ready for brunch, so it was not an inconvenience. My companion answered the door and said that we were not quite ready to leave. The housekeeper rolled her eyes, and asked when we would be gone. I was shocked. It wasn't like we were staying over check out time, I had two more nights here. I started to wonder if we had been blacklisted for complaining the night before. After this, I decided to limit my use of the hotel services as much as possible. I ordered breakfast the next morning. It arrived, and I was setting it up, when the server returned to my room because he had given me a plate that belonged to another hotel guest. So I suppose he just exchanged the plates because my eggs were returned to me cold and overcooked. I just ate them because I came to realize that a request to correct a problem is of no use here. The next morning, I stuck to a continental breakfast, which arrived on time and warranted no complaints. As for other issues, I really donâ€™t think they are worth commenting on after all the service concerns, but Iâ€™ll mention them quickly. The dÃ©cor was pleasant. The bedding was comfortable, but I found the pillows to be too tough. The comforter was shedding feathers, but they were very soft feathers. The restaurant menu was unappealing. In general, the food is named by the method of cooking and the protein. I would normally have cared that I was eating at a place with a menu that you might find at a truck stop, but I couldnâ€™t even care about that with the service issues. If I had even had mediocre service, or if management had made any effort to correct this horrible experience, I would have given them a higher rating, and I would have felt like I could recommend them to others. However, it was horrible to be committed to staying in this hotel, and I will never put myself in that situation again, and I certainly would never advise a friend to be stuck there.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Kennith Ledner","date":"2012-08-04 20:38:31 +0300"},{"content":"We stopped two nights in Boston at the end of a US trip and picked a Hyatt hotel at random as I expect them to be of a good standard. We found the Hyatt Regency Boston to be shabby and run down and not a good advertisement for the brand. Our room was cramped and basic - bits of woodwork chipped, walls marked. Our view out the window was out the back over a rooftop (can't have the good one all the time I guess!). The sports centre was a big let down. The changing facilities are grubby and dated. The changing room shower did not work, the sauna was not hot. And the pool was freezing. My young son had blue lips after 5 minutes in it. Interestingly, there is a van parked across the road from the hotel entrance with a big sign on it denouncing Hyatt hotels. Also not good advertising. Don't think we'll be visiting again.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Maryjane Tromp","date":"2015-11-16 10:23:01 +0300"},{"content":"Free shuttle from airport.

Paid only $70 per night for a standard queen room. You would think the Front Desk should be the \"FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE\" for the hotel. The staffs barely greeted you. I was standing there for almost 5 mins & only one person in front of me. Front desk staffs stared at me for a little while before he said anything. ****Check in was for bad.**** Arrived early & the room was not ready. Front desk told us they would call once the room is available. Check in time was 4PM. No phone called from them, called the hotel ourselves at 4:30PM was told the room now available. We arrrive at 6PM. Guessed what?!! NO ROOM STILL. Waited another 30mins. WATCH OUT. We got the bill for all the charges everything looked fine. When tried to pay we were told THERE AND THEN. there were a $35 charges per night for upgrade. WOO HOO. What a surprise??? We were not even told when we waited 4 hours for our room. SWEEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTTTTTTTT!!! After all the compliants NOW here are the good sides of the hotel: Room was fine. Roomservices were very warm & professional. But setting is old. It was a very old building. Great location for first time traveller. It is only worth for 4 stars for the \"Hyatt\" name. Front desk services are barely there. Amenties were just average. From my world travel experience I would give it a 3 stars.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Hellen Skiles","date":"2015-08-25 01:59:41 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Demond Gerlach","Cassie Berge","Cade Rowe","Sydni Schuppe","Verner Schimmel","Edna Lesch","Santina Boyle"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Single-storey stone cottage by a stream.
