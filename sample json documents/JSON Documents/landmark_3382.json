It's a superlative, fashion and pop culture experience from the first floor to the fifth, a dizzying array of trendy 'must-haves' and the most highfalutin' and buzz-worthy cosmetics, attire, shoes and accessories featured in all the glossy magazines. Store itself is awash in vivid colors and hip displays; it's absolutely a unique shopping experience. Barney Greengrass, the top floor deli, is equally chic and draws in hungry shoppers who want a nice meal and to see and be seen (obviously).","geo":{"lat":34.06699,"lon":-118.40247,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"buy","type":"landmark","id":3382,"country":"United States","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"California"}
