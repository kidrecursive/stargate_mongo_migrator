We stayed 5 days and 4 nights the resort was at about 60 percent capacity. The strength of this property is the nice rooms, world class beach and water park pool area. Our room was clean the king bed was comfortable and the staff did a wonderful job keeping us stocked with towels. The beach is gorgeous and water park pool fun! Weakness included inconsistent customer service, food, grounds and employee attitudes, plus the ever present nickel and dime charging. My wife wasnâ€™t impressed by the spa she went for one treatment early in our trip and never returned. Warning: The stone area around the pool is slippery witnessed several adults and children slipping and falling on the stone tile surrounding the upper pool area. Also there is a lack of shade around the pools, so you need to get to the pool early in order to stake claim to a shaded standard lounge chairs. Beach goers need to arrive early before 9am to stake claim to one of the limited number of beach umbrella and lounge chairs available at no additional charge. The wind came up by noon each day so we would do the beach in the morning and the pool in the afternoon. Even with its short comings we had a good time, but I would only return to the Grand Wailea during non-peak travel times.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":2.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Theo Little","date":"2012-05-14 20:37:22 +0300"},{"content":"First impression is breathtaking. A welcome and lei is presented by bell staff, prior to arrival at the Front Desk. Check in was easy and quick , even though the hotel was busy due to spring break. After a warm welcome by the front desk staff, we were taken to our room which was spotless; and kept that way by hk for the entire stay. Room Service was the best and fairly priced. Dinner at the Mokikini Bistro was great, service was outstanding; and each child was presented with a free stuffed animal at the end of the meal. The beach is to die for, and there is no charge for the umbrellas. There is a \"Kids Club\" which provides activities and meals for the children, the staff goes out of their way to make the kids happy; and it is a great feature of this hotel. The team members at this resort are always anxious to help guests, and make them happy. This is where this hotel really shines. All of the team members have a great attitude. In conclusion , this really is the best resort on Maui.","ratings":{"Overall":5.0},"author":"Neva Gislason","date":"2015-12-06 21:33:48 +0300"},{"content":"I traveled from Honolulu with my wife and two young girls ages 6 and 8 during the week of March 20, 2011 for a five day vacation at the Grand Wailea. Upon arrival, the hotel was reportedly at about 90% occupancy. There are approximately 780 rooms to the Property. Assuming an average of 3.0 people per room this would equate to 2100 guests more or less exclusive of staff during our stay. The facilities and staff simply can not come close to servicing that amount of people to any degree, let alone to a four or five star level. The main attraction to the hotel, the pools and slides become so crowded and so chaotic by noon that it is difficult to imagine that after the initial pleasure of merely being in Hawaii wears off the mid west or east coast traveler, one doesn't feel stressed over fighting over towls and chairs and space. It is Lord of the Flies at $1,000 a day. By 7:45 am 95% percent of the chairs around the multi level pool complex are completely taken. By 8:00 am 100% are taken. No one is actually using the pool or is even at the pool at that hour however. The one hour policy to \"reserve\" your chair is not enforced and in fact I actually witnessed on Friday March 25 at approx 11:00 am two young girls ages 8 and 10 , who had claimed two chairs and were quietly sitting next to me (which had been cleared by security about 30 minutes prior due to a guest placing a book there at approx 7:00 am and quickly disappearing) removed by hotel security because the guest returned 4 hours later and claimed he had BEEN USING THE CHAIR- A BLATANT AND OBVIOUS LIE. THE YOUNG GIRLS WERE SCARED, THE 5FT 10 260LB WHITE MALE GOT HIS CHAIR BACK,because the hotel secuity made the expedient decision after looking at thesize of the belligerent male and then the two little innocent girls who would be easier to deal with and the young girls had their day ruined. You could provide that friendly spring break experience for your kids without spending a 1,000 dollars a day for room and meals! Thank God the girls parents were not there at the time or there might have been a stabbing! So much for the blind eyes of Justice! Not once by the pool in five days did a server ever ask if we were interested in placing a food order. When we did eat by the pool the food was horrible. I do not mind the prices but the food was horrendous. The rooms were fair but can not compare to any four star or five star hotel in Kona, Lanai, or even next door at the Four Seasons. It is not enough for Management to say that occupancy is 90% and things get tight. A hotel need that number in order to make money so obviously the business plan for this Hotel coupled with the size and design do not provide functional utility for the guests ,and hence, this hotel constitutes a very poor value and a terrible waste of money. Management, let me tell you something: from 7am to 10 am the amount of people that are actually using the pool and need to legtimately \"claim\" a chair for immediate use is around zero. Issue towels and chairs at 10:00am and not earlier before someone gets killed!!!","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Nathanial Herman","date":"2014-09-25 18:41:54 +0300"},{"content":"My family recently stayed at the Grand Wailea for a week and we had a really nice time. We loved the resort location and we were really pleased with our room. We had a Deluxe Ocean View room that was nice and spacious, had a decent sized balcony and had great views of the ocean and pool area. Our room was very clean and the property seemed clean the entire week we were there. As others have mentioned, the rooms are pricey and everything at the resort was expensive, but it wasn't a surprise....most places in Maui are pretty pricey. We have a 3 year old son who travelled with us and he had a ball at the pool. There was so much to do (even for little ones). The spa is amazing and is a must-do for anyone who stays at or anywhere near the resort. In general we had a fantastic time, but we did make note of a couple of things that could be improved upon: - One downside to the pool was the limited number of pool chairs. People get in line at 7am to claim their pool chairs and some people leave them unoccupied for hours. The rule is one hour only, but on most days we saw chairs being left unoccupied for 2-3 hours. - Prior to our vacation we called and asked about cabana rentals and were told we wouldn't need to book a cabana in advance, that it could be booked when we arrived. Regardless of that information, we called the week before our vacation and booked a cabana near the baby beach. When we arrived at the resort we called to confirm the cabana rental and were told that they had no record of our cabana reservation. We figured they'd be a little apologetic, but they really weren't. We were then told that people book the cabanas months in advance (which was completely different from what we were told weeks prior to our trip). The upside was we saved $250 in the cabana rental for that day! - The food and drink service at the pool was hit or miss. We went an entire day without anyone coming to take a drink order. Late in the afternoon, we saw a server and my husband asked her if she could come over to get our drink order and she did, but with zero enthusiasm and customer service skills that most servers at a resort of this caliber would display. On other days we had great pool service so i guess it really just depends on the server. Everyone else at the resort was extremely friendly and our overall experience was great. We had such a lovely time we definitely plan to go back and we would stay at the Grand Wailea again.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Myra Mosciski","date":"2015-05-17 19:54:04 +0300"},{"content":"I read all of these reviews before deciding on the Grand Wailea for a week with my family, which includes young children. Yes, it is pricey and you should not go if you can't stomach paying $20 for a cocktail, but it was totally worth it for us. The location is amazing, the beach is perfect and close (unlike the Fairmont and Four Seasons) and the pools are heaven for young kids. Nothing else compares to the pool scene here. The Fairmont and Four Seasons are more grown up and elegant in my opinion, but this is not what we wanted with young children. You can tell the resort was built in the early 90s and definitely needs a little updating (the peach paint on the exterior is cheesy), but the grounds are beautiful and huge. Until our children are older, we would not change a thing as they had the time of their lives. The fridge in our room was complimentary by the way. The room was decent and clean but not huge. You could see some wear and tear in the bathrooms, so updating will likely happen in the near future, one would hope. But these were all minor complaints as we had a fabulous holiday here. Our breakfast was included and we loved the buffet at the grand dining room every morning. I had a mediocre massage at the spa, but the baths there were lovely. Highly recommend this hotel to families. If you are a stickler for perfection, go to the Four Seasons, where the scene is little more quiet and grown up. The Grand Wailea was heavenly for us.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Roscoe Bode","date":"2012-05-26 03:08:38 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed here for 10 days from Jan 15 to Jan 25. It was our first trip to Maui and our purpose was to relax. The hotel is set in beautiful grounds with water features and sculptures everywhere. The lush gardens are constantly being worked on - we thought they were beautifully kept. The hotel's facilities were wide ranging: the extensive pools were fantastic fun for all ages. There was staff located at each rapid, or at the tarzan swing from 10am to 5pm for safety. The rapids and slides are closed outside of these times - but there was plenty of other pool space to enjoy after that. We were able to get sun beds every day at our leisure - there was no annoying reserving of stuff at 6.30 am. The Spa Grande was a lovely experience. We took the special deal $149 which gave an hour's use of the spa baths/saunas etc before a 50min massage (included $25 toward a lunch/dinner at Molokini bistro). I thought this was an enjoyable and indulgent experience - both our masseurs were great. Make sure you get there an hour before your massage to use the different baths and saunas etc. The gym was excellent for a hotel - better equipped than some professional gyms! There are some gym classes but some you have to pay an extra $10 eg. spin classes. The yoga classes are complimentary. Give it a go even if you're a beginner. I liked the 7am beach yoga with no-nonsense Nancy. Our room was in the lagoon wing on the 1st floor. Great king size bed, beautiful bathroom - all kept clean. Wifi in room. Everything good quality and worked. Amazing sunsets. Breakfast in the Grand Dining room - a huge buffet with American/European/Hawaiian/Japanese dishes and an egg station. During our 10-day stay we were always able to choose something we liked from the buffet. Staff was quick to refill, in our experience. Egg guy was great. We found the staff at Grand Wailea to be friendly and non-intrusive (which is how we like it). I suppose I could go on - but the review is already a bit rambling. On the whole we had an amazing stay - something for everyone. The one annoyance was the $25 daily resort fee. You know of course before you book. I liked the fact that you didn't have to go with the valet parking at $20 a day but you could self-park and this was included in the $25 fee. They have now changed this arrangement and you have to take the valet parking at $20 p/day and the resort fee has been reduced to $20 p/day. Just take this in to account when you are looking at the daily cost of staying at this hotel.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Marques Prohaska","date":"2013-12-05 16:01:19 +0300"},{"content":"Rooms: We got a basic garden view room, it was the least expensive, but did not seem cheep in any way. I asked about an upgrade and was told they were at 100% occupancy with none available. We were in the Chapel wing on the first floor and I must say the room was amazing. I was very impressed. The bed was very comfortable, the room, bathroom, patio, were huge, and very well appointed. Beautiful bathrooms, beautiful furniture, and we even had a waterfall near our door in one of the many amazing gardens. Humuâ€™s: I got a Mai Tai, which normally I am not a fan of when they give them out at most Hawaiian hotels, but this was highly recommended by some other guests; letâ€™s just say I am a fan of Humuâ€™s Mai Tais. Wow! The service was impeccable, attentive, and knowledgeable. The food was all good. I recommend the Ahi Traps. Resort food tends to be expensive, thought the GWâ€™s food wasnâ€™t outrageously expensive, it was actually less than I expected. (Please donâ€™t use this as a cue to raise your prices). Pools: For being at 100% occupancy, the hotel sure did not feel crowded. They really did a great job of laying things out, having a variety of pools, etc. Donâ€™t get me wrong, it was pretty crowded, but it still felt personable, lots of small pool areas, etc. Most of the chairs were taken if we didnâ€™t rush out at 6am, but we eventually found two chairs together both days. Also, be sure you go to the activities desk and get a wrist band each day. We didnâ€™t know this our first day, and security will ask you to leave if you donâ€™t have one. I guess people try to sneak in from the Four Seasons or the Marriott? There were a lot of children, though Hawaii is a family destination, so we expected this. Most were very well behaved, supervised by parents, etc. But I feel I need to warn others who are looking for more of an adult only retreat, thought they did have an adult only pool, but that was more crowded than others. The pools are fun. They have a network of waterslides connecting the pools and even have a water elevator if you donâ€™t want to climb the stairs. I donâ€™t think I have been to a water park type place in over 20 years; letâ€™s just say I had a lot of fun. Many other adults were partaking in the waterslides too. Pool/Food/Bars: We have stayed in a lot of resort type places over the past few years, and the GW is defiantly in the top two to three. The staff is so nice and helpful, very personable. The drinks by the pool are reasonably priced for a resort of this caliber, and they do not skimp on the alcohol. The food was amazing, even with pool side service. The pool side service is slow, but the wait staff always told us what the expected time would be, as they prepare all of the food fresh. They also have a grotto bar that you swim up too. Itâ€™s inside a cave with flowers growing out of the walls, amazing! Though the music gets loud later in the day, but they have tables outside the bar as well, also in the water. We had such a great time at the GW and canâ€™t wait to go back. It was an amazing experience, beautiful grounds which we walked for hours, amazing hospitality, and everything was just designed really well. There is shopping on site, and an outdoor mall within walking distance. They have activities on site, though we didnâ€™t participate in much on this stay. We did go to the marine station and learn about whales. But we were more into relaxing and hanging by the pool and walking on the beach.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Lelah Krajcik","date":"2014-06-23 12:01:55 +0300"},{"content":"We were looking for a luxurious getaway and planned a few nights at the Grand Wailea before heading off to Kauai.

The conference rate was substantially below the rack rates for the rooms. Grounds are fantastic- one of the nicest hotels I've ever been to, and I have traveled a fair amount. Truly impressive- especially the pools, which may be some of the nicest in the world. They have a lei greeting and an impressive entrance. I was a little disappointed when we checked in, because the person at the front desk gave me a hard time about the room type. I brought my wife with me and the room type was a big deal for us- this was both a late anniversary celibration and her birthday was the final day of our trip. We wanted it to be special. I used to have a fairly decent Hilton Hhonors level status, but we have two young kids and I lost it since I haven't traveled as much since they were born. I mention this because as with any other hotel, your status matters in how they treat you. Since our conference rate was the same price for a variety of room types, this issue probably wouldn't apply to those who pay a set price for a specific room type. I booked way ahead to reserve a 'deluxe oceanfront' room. A colleague with higher Hhonors status who booked when only garden view rooms were available requested an oceanfront room (right next to me in line) and they gave it to him without hassle. The person at the counter gave me a garden room and then told me three times that room types are not guaranteed. I was getting ready to ask for a manager when she finally (reluctantly) agreed to give me the room type I booked. I would understand if she said it once to make the point, but I just traveled 15 hours from the east coast to get there, and I expect that if the hotel can simply accomodate the request I made, that they do so without hassling me. Although the start was rocky, the rest of the stay improved. Again, the grounds are fantastic. Amazing. The room itself was nice, but not commensurate with the price of the hotel. I would have been a little disappointed if we paid full price. As many other reviews state, you are paying for the grounds. They're worth it. Our view was not as good as a couple of other oceanfront rooms on site that my colleagues got, but I did have an ocean view and that was good enough. Our room had a shower and large (non-jetted) tub and a balcony with a table and chairs. The pictures on the website seem to be fairly accurate- this is not always the case with some hotels, but what you see is what you get here. This room would have been expected in a standard hilton beach property, but not in a waldorf astoria. It is due for a remodel in the rooms. I had emailed in advance about a fridge for the room because food is EXPENSIVE on and near the property. Get a rental car, because a cab is about $60 each way to/from the airport and there is great food fairly reasonably priced in Kihei about 5 miles down the road. Parking was a little annoying- the parking garage is a quarter mile down the road if you don't want to pay for the valet. The on-site eating options are good, but quite expensive. We had dinner at humuhumunukunukuapuaa and it was very nice. My wife had lobster and steak, and I had sushi and fresh fish ceviche. Both were nicely prepared. They told me the fridge would be $25 for the whole stay. When I checked in, they said $5 delivery charge plus $8 a day. Then when we checked out after five nights, there was an almost $80 charge (no idea where they got this figure)! The front desk happily adjusted it to $25 when I showed the email that I got from the hotel representative. The worst part- the fridge was already in the room the whole time!!! All they did was come in and use a key to unlock the cabinet where it was stored. On the second day of our stay, we noticed that the fridge had frozen our items. The milk was a hard slush, beers were nearly frozen, everything else was inedible because it was too cold. Tried turning down the thermostat, that only made it worse. Everything froze hard, so we couldn't use the milk for our coffee and I was afraid the glass beer bottles would explode if I took them out by hand. I mentioned the problem to the front desk and they volunteered to get us a new fridge and replace all the food items right away. They replaced the beer, milk, and cream. We also had bought guacamole dip and french onion dip at the grocery store. They replaced them with fresh guacamole and had the chef whip us up some french onion dip using Maui sweet onions. I mention the fridge incident not because I hold it against the hotel that the first fridge broke, but because it shows that they do take the effort to try and fix problems when they occur. Although we had a rough day without our coffee, the effort the hotel made to fix it made up for the problem. The dips were delicious! When not at the conference, we did the typical tourist stuff (road to hana, sunrise at the volcano, etc.). But I spent the most (non-work) time at the pool. The slides and lazy river are great! Spent some time (and a few bucks) at the grotto bar. If you pay a little extra, you can get a big pineapple mug that holds a lot more than the other cups and you get a whole lot more drink for you money the rest of your trip. I didn't figure this out until too late. Speaking of drink deals, there was a (unadvertised, as far as I could tell) happy hour in the main bar in the middle of the hotel from 5-6 with a serious discount on mai tais. The beach in front of the hotel is pristine. Swimming there is comfortable and safe. We booked a snorkeling trip to two sites- Molokini crater and turtle town. Drove a half hour north of the hotel to get to the boat (boss frogs, which was inexpensive and great), and they went to molokini first. Then, turtle town ended up being directly in front of the hotel!!! If you have (or rent) snorkel gear, you can easily check out the turtles on the southern end of the beach in front of the hotel. You can swim or kayak out just a little bit and see the turtles surfacing. Some were almost as big as a vw beetle. My wife visited the spa on her birthday and loved it. The locals had told us (when we mentioned where we were staying) that our hotel had the best spa on the island. My wife didn't try any others, but certainly enjoyed this one very much. In summary, the grounds were amazing, the room was nice (if not quite up to our expectations), and expect to pay extra for everything. The location in Wailea is great. Stay here, but don't expect to do so frugally! We had a wonderful trip and while there were a couple of things that could have been done better, the hotel generally met or exceeded our expectations and we would stay here again.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Kory Gorczany","date":"2014-03-26 11:32:19 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Simeon Hayes","Mr. Christop Boyer","Angie Funk"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Another semi-cheapie right in the middle of everything.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":true}
