I was developing a terrible cold when we arrived, but the easy check-in, the champagne split the manager sent to our room and the cozy warmth of the fireplace helped keep the cold at bay. Although we couldn't enjoy the many facilities and services we had planned to, the location of the hotel made walking a simple exercise, even for somebody well under the weather. About the only amenity I could have wished for, however, was an in-room coffee maker, just to get me on my feet. There was simple coffee in the lobby and all kinds of stuff in the fridge, but if I had felt better, we would have picked up a cup and carb at one of the nearby patisseries to carry back to the suite. Lack of eye-openers notwithstanding, I would recommend this hotel to anyone, whether visiting the city for leisure or business travel.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Carmela Gerlach","date":"2012-11-24 03:20:57 +0300"},{"content":"Great hotel; great service and ammenities and top of the line furnisihngs - We highly reccomend it!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Enoch Moen","date":"2014-02-22 01:53:44 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Brook Mayer","Savannah Adams","Cletus Schimmel","Frances VonRueden DVM","Dominic Wolf","Ms. Cole Ruecker","Katlynn Streich","Isai Zboncak","Vincenzo Sipes"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Located in quiet area.
