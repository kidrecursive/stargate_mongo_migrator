The villa was spotless, the staff helpful, friendly and charming, the jeep was perfect for our needs and the island of Culebra was alittle bit of heaven. We had a great time snorkeling, sunning, reading, hiking. The residents of the island were friendly and courteous. It was fabulous!","ratings":{"Overall":5.0},"author":"Eryn Becker","date":"2013-08-07 00:54:28 +0300"},{"content":"Great choice of hotel. My sister had a wedding and her and fiancÃ© checked out few places to suggest. 5 or 6 couples / singles stayed here. We had 6 nights, greeted by Suzanna and shown around, so we knew lay of the hotel. Rooms were large enough and comfortable. Walk- in large shower. Nice to have assortment of beach chairs provided. Beach towels provided. Perfect sandy beach with fun to play in ocean waves. Separate entrance when we came from beach, and used shower to remove sand on feet. Spent lots of time in large jacuzzi, with family members and friends: perfect temperature. Front desk always got us taxi service within 5-10 minutes. We also took bus into Old San Juan about 2 blocks away (#21 & 53). Convenient location. On last day with 11am checkout, we left bags, stayed at beach, and used shower on 4th floor before heading to airport. We highly recommend.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Robbie Pacocha","date":"2012-11-08 02:14:29 +0300"},{"content":"We checked into this hotel on Tuesday Evening January 10,2012. I have to say that it was the worst experience ever. We had reservations at \"A Wind Chimes\" hotel and were told they did not have our reservation but we could stay at their sister hotel, Acacia. We were told at ten o,clock at night to carry our bags down the very dark street to the Acacia. Wait a moment, we were booked at one hotel and switched to another. For two weary travelers it was to much to comprehend and we trudged to the Acacia. Beware upon arrival they slam you with there rules one of which is you can not get your money back if the room does not meet your expectations. I awoke to having a severe allergic reaction which I recognized instantly as being the result of the presence of mold. My husband investigated and found considerable mold in the bathroom and air conditioner. My husband and I agreed that we could not remain at the hotel. We expressed our desire to leave the hotel to the desk clerk who referred the matter to her manager.The manager was a very rude women who in no uncertain terms advised us that we had booked a four night stay and if we desired to leave we would be charged for a three night stay. To our shock, the problems my wife was having with the mold in the room WERE COMPLETELY IGNORED!!! We left the hotel very bitter and completely resentful of the way we were treated. So beware if you should become ill or have an emergency you will be in for the three night stay rule.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":1.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":1.0},"author":"Brenden Ullrich","date":"2012-02-25 22:57:58 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Laurianne Bergnaum","Maverick Pouros I","Oran Shields IV"],"vacancy":false,"description":"3-star hotel.
