It is a typical example of the 19th century &quot;eclectic&quot; style, with architectural elements recalling antique, classical and Gothic eras. The Byzantine-style interior decoration is extremely exuberant, too much so for some people. Tours of the roof and bell towers are available in the afternoons for €6.","geo":{"lat":45.7623,"lon":4.8225,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":17034,"country":"France","city":"Lyon","state":"Rhône-Alpes"}
