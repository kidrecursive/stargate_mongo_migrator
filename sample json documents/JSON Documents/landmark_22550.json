Considered to be home to some of Robert Adam's finest interiors, particularly in the neoclassical Saloon, Saltram is a fantastically preserved example of an early Georgian house. It is also particularly interesting as the various 'eras' of the house are still visible, including Tudor and Palladian. It was home to the Earls of Morley, the Parker family, who were patrons of Sir Joshua Reynolds and enjoyed close friendships with Jane Austen. The estate itself is vast, and the gardens, orangery and folly are all worth a visit. Note that the grounds get crowded at certain times of the year.","geo":{"lat":50.3816,"lon":-4.0824,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":22550,"country":"United Kingdom","city":null,"state":null}
