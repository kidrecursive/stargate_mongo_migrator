It has a motel/dorm room type feel. It faces the busiest street in Istanbul so if you're unlucky enough to get a front room you will be bombarded at all hours with a lot of noise. However, if you bring ear plugs it's fine. On the plus side the breakfast is great and the staff is lovely. It's also in the heart of it. So if you're there to party and be out late and not have to travel far this is the place to be. We enjoyed our stay here because we were out seeing the sites and all the city has to offer. If we wanted to hole up for a romantic getaway, this is not the place.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Service":4.0},"author":"Frances Abernathy","date":"2014-12-16 12:32:00 +0300"},{"content":"Found the apartment clean and it was cleaned on a daily basis.Staff were always polite and found the appartment value for money.Easy walking distance to Mall of Emirates and Metro.Stayed from December 27th to January 2nd.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Oma King","date":"2014-05-11 05:53:38 +0300"},{"content":"For 95 Sin$ a shoebox type of room with a shower hose in toilet is a rip off. the TV had a bout 1 english program and the rest of the channels where snowy white.
