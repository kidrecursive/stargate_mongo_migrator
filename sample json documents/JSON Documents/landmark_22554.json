Amid the smoke and ruins of the destroyed city centre, a headmistress nailed a simple wooden sign over the door of the bombed shell of the church; 'Resurgam' - 'I will rise again'. This famous gesture is often taken as a symbol of Plymouth's wartime spirit. This is not the Minster's only claim to fame; it has welcomed Catherine of Aragon, Sir Francis Drake and John Hawkins as well as Captain Bligh of the Bounty, to name a few.","geo":{"lat":50.36978,"lon":-4.13985,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":22554,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Plymouth","state":null}
