The rooms have the decor, and simplistic layout traditional of a European Hotel. The shower / water pressure is \"ala\" Germany where there is ample water pressure and flow. The Seinfield Episode where Kramer has illegal shower heads comes to mind because it is easy to want to stay in the shower for long periods of time (just don't wash the produce off in the shower)! The Aveda amenties are superior to those that you would find in typical chain hotels. Although the Lumen is not on par with the other Kimpton Hotel nearby, it is a very good value and has a great location and service.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":3.0},"author":"Vena Osinski","date":"2013-12-05 19:37:20 +0300"},{"content":"The walls are very thin, so when the neighbors next door came back at midnight and talked until 2 am, I heard every word (even though I put earplugs in and had a pillow over my head). Also, my room was in the same hallway as the management offices, so during the day, there is a lot of talking and conversing back and forth across the offices, which makes it very noisy as well. For some reason, they don't close the doors to the management offices. Also, be aware that their restaurant doesn't open for lunch, so you have to grab something elsewhere for lunch. It is a pet friendly hotel, and they have a lovely dog that greets guests at the front desk...but be warned if you have pet allergies. I had read the reviews about the shower in the middle of the room - it is very odd that the shower is adjacent to the bed except for a sheer curtain.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":2.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Evelyn Stoltenberg","date":"2013-01-10 08:59:09 +0300"},{"content":"Went to Orlando with my parents, husband and two kids last week. Had read some shady reviews about the Calypso Cay Resort and didn't want to take any chances. I found WorldQuest online by doing a little research and was so glad we switched. First of all, the facility is beautiful and the pool was a huge highlight for our boys. Staff was very pleasant and check-in and out was a breeze. We stayed in a 3 bedroom unit which suited all of our needs and having the kitchen and our own separate bathrooms was a joy! Very quiet facility. Nice to not hear the noise from the other rooms and nice to be away from the crowds of people after a full day at disney. The shuttle service was superb and free! Insiders tip - we had an amazing taxi driver on the days we did not take the shuttle. His name is Van{not sure how to spell it} and he drives a van! He was one of the highlights of our trip. He was a super driver and took such good care of us. Drove us out to the Space Center{45 minute drive each way} and was there promptly to pick us up. Took us to a great restaurant for dinner{Golden Corral} great food and cheap! He is such a nice, hard working man. Taxi drivers must pay to lease their vehicles and he pays $1500.00 per week for his van. Gas not included. He works over 18 hours a day. So if you are going to Orlando, please request him. He is a sweetheart!!!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Wellington Pfannerstill","date":"2015-04-23 23:45:35 +0300"},{"content":"I want to provide both the pros and the cons of the resort: Pros: 1. The rooms were lovely and spacious. 2. Well decorated 3. Felt as if you were in an apartment or condo 4. The kitchen was well stocked if you had a desire to cook or have meals without going out. 5. The pool area was nice. 6. A gated property where your parking tag as displayed to enter and exit the facility 7. Breakfast was provided. 8. Excellent proximity to the parks 9. A safe for valuables. 10. Screened in patio that allowed our granddaughter to be outside without the fear of her falling over. Cons: 1. I requested an early check-in. I called upon landing at 10:30 and was told to call again at 2:00. I arrived at the property at 3:00 and waited in a rather small lobby with several other disgruntled families waiting for their room. Was not assigned a room until closer to 4:00. There was only one person checking in a line of people. When he asked the person behind me to go to the next window I informed him I was already told by her that she was \"busy.\" 2. I asked to be in a building near the front of the property since my husband has a health condition and I am always concerned about an ambulance. We were placed in Building 6 near the back of the property. 3. We had a two bedroom unit. The toilet in one of the bathrooms did not work properly, and the other bathroom's toilet had a broken handle. I called, but they were never fixed properly. 4. One evening we came back rather late to find our door \"unlocked.\" Our three year old granddaughter pulled on the handle before we inserted the key and it just opened. 5. I called about the lock but nobody showed up when we asked. The next day we called again and I was told they would send someone \"right out.\" After waiting we left with the hope that our belongings would not be disturbed we left for the park as nobody arrived. 6. The day of check out, we were awakened at 9:20 to make sure we were leaving. At 10:50, another knock on the door asking if we were leaving. I said yes, within 30 minutes. I asked if I had to check out and she said \"no, just leave the key cards.\" While waiting for my daughter to finish, I stripped the sheets from the bed, vacuumed the carpet, swept the kitchen floor, my husband emptied the trash, placed the towels in one area, etc. and took our bags to the van. At 11:20 the phone rang and a woman â€œcheck-out time is at 11:00.â€� By then, I was livid. I proceeded to tell her I was aware of the time and she was the THIRD person who asked when we were leaving and rattled off the requests that I had and were not fulfilled. I also told her I began cleaning the room while waiting to leave. She told me â€œquit taking it personally.â€� I replied I am not taking it personally but I am insulted that this is the third notice for a twenty minute delay. Two of the notices began prior to the check-out time, I said when I get home; I will post how I was treated on Trip Advisor. Her response was â€œdo what you have to do.â€� She was unapologetic the entire time. She also asked how she is supposed to know that I had been contacted twice before, I suggested they improve their communication system.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Julianne Corkery","date":"2012-09-03 21:30:26 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed here in December 2011 based on a recommendation from a friend. I had asked (via Facebook) for any recommendations for a condo to stay while in the Disney area. We were traveling with our two young children, my mother, and my sister, and thought a condo would be a better option than the two hotel rooms we had booked nearby. After speaking to my friend and thoroughly researching the property here in tripadvisor, we decided to give it a shot. I am glad we did - we stayed three nights in a three bedroom in Building 3 and were very comfortable. We had a couple of minor issues - the kitchen sink was emitting a strange smell and there were some items under beds and the couch that likely could have been cleaned up with a more thorough cleaning crew. We didn't make a big deal of the sink since we were rarely at the condo, though I am sure they would have at least checked it out if we had called it in. We just returned from a second three night stay yesterday and again had a very pleasant experience. This time it was just us and the kids, though we did have a three bedroom again (Building 2 this time, on a high floor - nice view) because it was a last minute trip and evidently the two bedrooms are booked early. No matter, the nightly rate was still more reasonable than just ONE room at any of the hotels (at least any that we would want to stay at) nearby and we saved money just by having a kitchen and washer/dryer. Additionally, our sanity was saved thanks to our kids being able to have a separate room. I noticed a similar cleanliness issue on this trip - trash was found under one of the beds that really should not have been there - makes you wonder what else is missed. Additionally, the bathrooms seem to be showing some wear and tear and could have used a good caulking - but this is typical for the humidity of Florida (we live in the state as well and have similar issues in our bathrooms). We did not take advantage of the pool on either trip, but it looks like a great place to have some fun. We also did not do breakfast - I have seen a lot of people complaining about the lack of variety, but this is a continental breakfast that is included in the room rate, I don't see why that warrants a complaint. It is just as easy to drive to the Publix that is five minutes away and get some healthier options and eat in your own condo, on your own time, without being crowded. Additionally, after reading the negative reviews on the park shuttles, we opted to drive ourselves to the theme parks and felt that this really was the way to go. Bottom line is that this is a very affordable place to stay, generally clean, and extremely convenient to the parks, without making you a slave to the Disney property. We will never stay anywhere else when we go to Disney.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Reanna Hettinger","date":"2012-05-05 07:02:23 +0300"},{"content":"Very nice condo-like resort convenient to all Disney Resorts and other attractions.

The 2-bedroom condo we stayed in was comfortable, beautiful and well priced. The staff accomodated our request for and adjacent 3-bedrm condo so the entire family could be close. It really was a home away from home. An initial stop and the 24-hour Super Walmart down the street allowed us to stock the Kitchen for quick meals that saved us a bundle from needing to purchase park food. A 10-min drive to the Magic Kingdom parking lot gave us the ability to leave a cooler in the car, which saved us a bundle on purchasing park food. Only negative comment I can make was that the water pressure in the shower was a little weak. Nothing that I couldn't live with though.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Jacques Langworth","date":"2015-07-14 19:22:03 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Florida Schamberger I","Clement Labadie","Leora Rau","Sven Eichmann","Otto Corkery"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Free use of pool and whirldpool in next door hotel Splendid.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
