Such travellers should rest assured that the curators at the Pompidou Centre have assembled a marvellous introduction consisting of mostly approachable works which delight, amuse, and entertain. The art is far from the only reason for a visit, as the building also contains a vast public library and a fine restaurant (run by the Costes brothers) on the roof. In fact the place is ''literally'' surrounded by some of the nicest pavement cafés in the city, in its superb location between the car-free above ground part of Forum Les Halles and the Marais art district.","geo":{"lat":48.860653,"lon":2.352411,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":21757,"country":"France","city":"Paris","state":"Île-de-France"}
