The bluffs above the beach are grassy, making a great spot for picnics. Keep in mind that La Jolla Cove is part of the San Diego-La Jolla Underwater Park Ecological Reserve, so fishing, scavenging, or &quot;swimming devices&quot; (surfboards, boogie boards, inflatable mattresses, etc.) are ''not'' allowed. You may also find a very large number of sea-birds and animals flying, walking and lazing around the area in the daytime.","geo":{"lat":32.84933,"lon":-117.27465,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":25179,"country":"United States","city":"San Diego","state":"California"}
