Entrance costs €8 for adults and €5 for children and students under age 30, but this includes an excellent audio guide for many of the paintings. The museum exhibits objects of very different types e.g. furniture, armour, paintings, knitted carpets, and silverware, but its highlight is definitely the Isenheim altarpiece by Gruenewald, a revolutionary Alsatian Renaissance painter. Even if you are not much into art it is still shocking to see how modern and inventive this painter was. The collection also includes paintings by Holbein the Elder, Renoir, and Picasso. The museum also shows some very interesting touring exhibits and also musical events. The locals are very proud of this museum and many people turn out for the openings of exhibits.","geo":{"lat":48.0797,"lon":7.3557,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":6218,"country":"France","city":"Colmar","state":"Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine"}
