It was still only a five minute walk from the main bus station, getting lost a couple of times, it was enough to make us unhappy campers by the time we arrived at reception tho!!! The receptionist was lovely, spoke very fluent English which was great. She showed us straight to our room, and it was beautiful. All the walls were lined with silk and a big four poster bed which was sooooo comfortable. Marble bathroom, spotlessly clean, and a view over the grand canal to watch all the comings and goings. Breakfast is buffet and continental, everything was fresh and lovely with a good choice. We left feeling very spoilt and lucky to stay at such a lovely hotel","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Garret Schultz","date":"2012-04-11 10:41:23 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Destini Wilderman MD","Reese Simonis Sr.","Helmer Herzog","Orval Gleason","Braden Corkery","Viviane Gerhold","Kiley Cartwright","Hayley Wolf PhD","Annie Gottlieb"],"vacancy":true,"description":"A popular youth hostel which is part of the 2nd most popularly rated hostel chain worldwide.
