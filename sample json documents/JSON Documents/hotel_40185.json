The staff was very friendly and helpful upon check-in. The rooms are very small (typical for NYC) but they make excellent use of space and it was very comfortable for the business traveler. Neat and clean with nice toiletries in the bathroom, a coffee maker and hotel safe. The breakfast in the associated restaurant next door was very nice and the location was convenient to the subway.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Deshaun Jast","date":"2013-01-19 09:03:40 +0300"},{"content":"I stayed here due to the price and walking distance to my meeting. Typical NYC Tiny Rooms. My room had a view of the ally, so it was quiet. For an overnight or even a couple of nights it would be ok.

The rooms were spotless (& NO sign of bedbugs!) & the area convenient for exploring the city. The staff were without exception smiling, polite & helpful; we would single out for special mention Angie the concierge who was always happy to answer questions & do all she could for us, including checking in online for our journey home.
