It was the ninth and last mission founded by Fermin Lasuen. Owing to the size of its physical plant and its land grant, as well as its success in converting neophytes, it received the moniker &quot;The King of the Missions&quot;. The oldest pepper tree in California was planted in San Luis Rey's courtyard. During the Mexican-American War, its alcalde (governor) was Sacagewea's son John Baptiste Charbonneau. It was rebuilt between 1895 and 1905 under the direction of Father Joseph O'Keefe.  A museum on site has exhibits on the history of the area and there are beautiful gardens to walk through.","geo":{"lat":33.232352,"lon":-117.319761,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":37505,"country":"United States","city":"Oceanside","state":"California","image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Mission_San_Luis_Rey_de_Francia_02.jpg"}
