You might want to avoid the Sunday buffet: diners have described the food as luke warm with rock hard bhajis like frisbees and very dreary music not helping the atmosphere. Speciality is '''''Lamb Sag''''' and all main dishes are served with polau (''sic'') rice or boiled rice or egg fried rice and the staff are really lovely and make an effort with everyone. You can book tables on-line. Does deliveries and takeaways too.","geo":{"lat":53.834974,"lon":-2.218903,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":36152,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Nelson","state":null}
