{"title":"Yosemite National Park","name":"Half Dome","alt":"17 mi (27.4 km) round-trip","address":"Starts at the Happy Isles shuttle bus stop","directions":null,"phone":null,"tollfree":null,"email":null,"url":null,"hours":null,"image":null,"price":null,"content":"One of the most spectacular trails in the world, the Half Dome trail travels past Vernal Falls, and Nevada Falls, and then continues rising through a pine forest before opening up near the summit of Half Dome.  The final mile is a grueling trek up granite steps, followed by wire cables that lead up the steep ascent to the top of Half Dome.  Hikers should bring  leather work gloves to protect their hands from the cables; some gloves are often available in a pile at the bottom of the cables.  While it is possible to ascend Half Dome while the cables are down (between approximately October 15 and May 15), hikers do so at their own risk.  Views and scenery are unforgettable, but hikers should be aware that the final climb up the back side of Half Dome via the cables can be exhausting and, for those with even a mild fear of heights, frightening.  According to a visitation study by the NPS, the least crowded days on Half Dome are Sunday and Friday (around 275) as compared to Monday and Thursday (around 730).
