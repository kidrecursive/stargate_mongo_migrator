You'll find it located near the historical Barbican area, which includes Britain's oldest bakery (Jacka's), and the Mayflower Steps from where the Pilgrim Fathers left for the New World in 1621. It's great for families too. You can reach it from the Mayflower Steps/Barbican by crossing the bridge across the lock that gives access to the marina. The bridge swings to let boats past, which is fun to watch. Admission charge applies. The aquarium also has an excellent fish restaurant outside, where you can eat in or take away.","geo":{"lat":50.3666,"lon":-4.1315,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":22542,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Plymouth","state":null}
