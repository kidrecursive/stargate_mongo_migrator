Metal at the Bel Air? Why did they ruin the bar with vile modern art that looks like Aaron Bros? Why does the patio have ugly metal fire lamps that don't give out heat? Why are the guest rooms black and white (with some pink, thank God) looking like the Viceroy Hotels? The dining room is way too small, and the outdoor patio is way too big with wasted space. The service and food are excellent. But how sad that they blew the decor everywhere.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Richie Keeling","date":"2013-11-18 06:54:42 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Derick Toy","Edgar Berge DVM","Chaya Lang DVM","Clark Macejkovic","Christian Lowe DDS","Miss Emmet Wintheiser","Mafalda Conn","Ms. Burley O'Kon"],"vacancy":false,"description":"One of the most inexpensive luxury 4 star hotels in Paris.
