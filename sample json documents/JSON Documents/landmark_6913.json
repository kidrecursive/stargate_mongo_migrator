Built by hand in 1888 by two railroad engineers, it is today a National Historic Landmark and has been a favorite location for films (including classics like ''Some Like it Hot'') and weddings. Many presidents and celebrities like Babe Ruth and Marilyn Monroe have stayed here. You can view it from the beach or Orange Avenue.","geo":{"lat":32.68092,"lon":-117.17833,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":6913,"country":"United States","city":"Coronado","state":"California"}
