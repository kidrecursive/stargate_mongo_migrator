This is one of the best sushi restaurants in a city packed with hundreds. The atmosphere is low key and if you can sit at the bar, Nobu is wonderful to chat with. The service is exceptional and more in line with a traditional Japanese sushi house.","geo":{"lat":37.7848,"lon":-122.4318,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":26250,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
