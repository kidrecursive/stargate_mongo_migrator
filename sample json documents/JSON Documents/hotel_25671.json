I guess that begins with the fact that the rooms are actually below the lobby - you feel like you are going back to the parking garage. We had a King/Spa room - the highest category. It was large and decently appointed. The fireplace was nice. We had a view of the courtyard - which was fine. But, for what we paid, I would have rather spent $50 more and stayed down the street at Hotel 1000 in one of their Executive Rooms. We found it strange that a boutique hotel wouldn't have wine glasses in the room - and when we called to request them, we were told we could retrieve them ourselves from the breakfast room. The breakfast room reminded my of the common area in a Holiday Inn Express or something of that caliber. Other reviewers are correct in that parking is difficult to navigate - you want directions. You not only get physical keys, but also 2 fobs for the garage and buidling access - it's quite a handful. Do ask for a quiet room - there are a couple that appear to be right under the viaduct exit. And, the heater is annoying as it turns itself on and off repeatedly all night long. All that said, the location at the Steps and near the market was nice. We probably won't stay there again, but it was decent.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":2.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Kamron Douglas","date":"2014-12-16 02:02:43 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed at Inn at Harbor Steps on a recent get-a-way to Seattle, WA. What a wonderful place. The Inn is in the heart of downtown. Only two blocks from Pikes Market and easy walking to Pioneer Square along with the Pier and other interesting places to go to. David at the front desk is fantastic and will help you with anything you need. They serve a very nice breakfast in the morning and in the afternoon there is cheese and goodies along with wine. The room is very nicely decorated and is very comfortable. I am very picky about beds in a hotel and this one was very nice. We will stay here again when we return to Seattle. We used the light rail from the air port down, $2.50 per person and you arrive 1 block from the hotel. We would recommend Inn at Harbor Steps to anyone.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Trevor Cremin","date":"2014-04-01 14:25:02 +0300"},{"content":"I loved everything about this hotel, and we stayed 11 days. Location is the best - can walk or hop a bus to everything. The food was wonderful - breakfast, cookies and happy hour! Staff were helpful and courteous.

An apologetic email eventually came back together with confirmation of booking. I also requested an early check-in but on our arrival at 10am after an overnight train journey we were not even provided with a room in which to freshen up. The hotel is part of a much larger apartment complex and is very strangely set up, sharing its facilities with the apartments but having its own separate reception desk tucked away in a corner. To get from reception to your room you have to go outside, across an open walkway, down an external staircase or in a public access lift which can be operated only with a key â€“ in fact, you are given no less than 3 keys!!!! The room was standard US hotel but had a pleasant enough balcony overlooking the harbour (yes, there's a 'u' in harbour) steps and the monstrosity of the waterfront elevated highway. Service was courteous but rarely more than than, breakfasts are served in a windowless room somewhere in the basement but a more pleasant afternoon happy hour (with unlimited wine and nibbles) can be enjoyed in the library. Where this hotel does score highly in my book is its location, diagonally opposite the Seattle Art Gallery, 5 mins from Pike Street Market, 2 mins from the waterfront and perhaps a 10 min walk from Pioneer Square. Otherwise, it was a bland â€˜corporateâ€™ feel hotel that has to be ranked last of all the hotels we stayed in during our 3 week tour of the US and Canada.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":2.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":3.0},"author":"Alivia Tillman","date":"2014-04-12 05:43:09 +0300"},{"content":"A friend recommended this hotel to us. While we loved the location, we didn't think it was worth the price tag. The much touted wine and cheese was sub par in a \"library\" of falling down books. The breakfast was mediocre. Our room was spacious but poorly laid out with no where to put our things. All in all, it seems like this was once a nice hotel but today, it is on the verge of shabby.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":2.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":2.0},"author":"Brian Langosh","date":"2012-09-30 05:40:31 +0300"},{"content":"This is absolutely the best hotel in which we have ever stayed. Not only are the rooms beautifully decorated, incredibly comfortable and wonderfully accented, the staff couldn't be more helpful and accommodating. The amenities (refrigerator and coffee maker, free soda, free full breakfast, afternoon tea) are beyond great! The location is superior, only two blocks off the harbor. A beautifully done, sophisticated hotel/inn which rivals the very best of them! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a wonderful experience in a great city.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Osvaldo Murazik","date":"2012-01-08 18:55:45 +0300"},{"content":"The Inn at Harbor Steps was a great find. Perfect location, well appointed rooms, extremely friendly and helpful staff. We had never visited Seattle before, but by the time we left, David and his staff made us feel like long valued friends.

Our rate was $175 ( plus $15.58 tax) per night. For that we got a large room and a nice breakfast buffet with both hot and cold food, along with an afternoon \"tea\" (wine) in the \"library.\" You might describe the place as sort of an impersonal B & B. The location is right smack in downtown Seattle just a couple of blocks from Pike Place Market, so you can walk most anywhere you'd like in the downtown (though Seattle is hilly, if you've never been there). (We did not have a car, so I cannot comment on the parking alternatives if you do have your own car.) The \"Inn\" is actually two lower levels, below street level on the uphill side, of a large, fairly modern apartment building. The furnishings are a little spare, sort of \"Pottery Barnish,\" but everything was clean and most everything worked well (thankfully a plunger was located next to the toilet). You enter a common reception lobby (no more) shared by the Inn guests and the apartment dwellers. There are two desks. One of the left for the apartments and one on the right for the Inn. There is no mixing these businesses. The appartment desk will not \"give you the time of day\" if you're there for the Inn. We figured that out pretty quickly. The Inn desk was very nice, however. We'd go back at the $175 price, which is much less than traditional hotels in the area. It's a good deal, given the location, assuming all you're looking for is a nice, clean, comfortable, quite room and a buffet breakfast before you head out on city.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4.0,"Check in / front desk":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Thalia Monahan","date":"2012-01-08 09:10:29 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Ken Flatley","Thomas Schimmel","Ms. Gilda Marks"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Nice hotel, centrally located (only two blocks from Pier 39).
