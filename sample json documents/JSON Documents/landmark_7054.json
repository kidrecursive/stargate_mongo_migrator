The front is a working barbershop with a nondescript door in the middle of the back wall.  Walk through that door and you're in a bar with a roaring-twenties theme.  The cigarette dispenser by the bathroom sells hair product, the fans are operated on pulley systems, and a free drink is offered with every barber service.  Cocktails are fancy and made by bar tenders who double as waitstaff.  Snacks include numerous varieties of grilled cheese and upscale bar munchies like sloppy joe sliders or imported olives.","geo":{"lat":34.01544,"lon":-118.40708,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":7054,"country":"United States","city":"Culver City","state":"California"}
