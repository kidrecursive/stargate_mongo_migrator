William the Conqueror initiated the building, but it was only completed and consecrated in 1094 in the reign of his son William II (Rufus). The Abbey is in an incomplete, partly ruinous state, having been dissolved during the Reformation, then re-used as a private home. Visitors can stand on the reputed site where Harold was slain on 14 October 1066.","geo":{"lat":50.91496,"lon":0.48483,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":2517,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Battle","state":null}
