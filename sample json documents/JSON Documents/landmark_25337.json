On one hand, it's a fine, manageably-sized market with all the quality brands of pasta, meat, dairy, condiments, juices, vegetarian staples, etc. that you would hope for in a neighborhood with a significant upscale, foodie population. On the other hand, the prices are high, and it would be really nice to be able to purchase a razor blade or non-natural hair conditioner. Great wine selection and recommendations, though.","geo":{"lat":37.73889,"lon":-122.41668,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"buy","type":"landmark","id":25337,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
