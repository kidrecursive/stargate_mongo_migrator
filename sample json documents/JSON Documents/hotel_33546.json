Staff were very helpful. The rooms were large, extremely clean and imaginative in design. As we only booked last minute room only we didn't sample the restaurant or breakfast. There are plenty of places nearby to eat which I prefer to try rather than stick to the same hotel restaurant every morning.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Dion Stracke","date":"2012-04-01 05:14:48 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Emelie Smith","Cheyenne Gutkowski","Cristopher Harvey","Maxie Adams","Callie Brakus"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Due in part to the presence of a large consulting company in Woking, a large corporate Holiday Inn is located in the centre of the town.
