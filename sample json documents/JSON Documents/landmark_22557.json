Good views over the conservation area of '''Plympton St Maurice''', an ancient stannary [tin-mining] town worth seeing for its well-preserved medieval streets and architecture in the historic vernacular, including an old school, church and small guildhall. Many houses also boast fine Georgian facades. The castle has no 'gatekeeper'; i.e. it is open all year round, at all times of the day - just walk in and explore! NB: The motte is a very steep climb.","geo":{"lat":50.383825,"lon":-4.049781,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":22557,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Plymouth","state":null}
