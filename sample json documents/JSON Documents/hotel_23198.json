The strip-view room I had was quite spacious. There were no noise issues as some have mentioned from outside. The downfall came in service. The front desk was generally reluctant to answer questions and the workers there seemed cold and unfriendly. The only employees who seemed particular friendly were the housekeeping staff. Not what I would have expected from what is trying to be a 5 star hotel. Since many people (myself included) realize that the hotel is a good value for a room but the prices are high in other respects, I have a few suggestions on saving on the extras: (1) Taxi from the airport: always tell the driver to take Paradise Road. If not, once he hears Encore (or Wynn) he will likely take you on the highway and it will double the cost. (2) Water/snacks: walk to 7-11 about 1-2 blocks north of Encore on same side of street. Caveat: the area is not as nice as most of the strip south. Upside: bottled water for $1 instead of $8 in the hotel room. (3) Fashion mall: across from Encore/Wynn. Starbucks for breakfast is half the price of the cafe in the hotel. Also, Sushi Ra has good half price sushi from 5 - 7pm. (4) Boarding pass: Encore/Wynn lets you print it for free in their business center instead of paying their usual $1 per minute internet rate.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Location":3.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Shyann Hyatt","date":"2012-10-24 11:16:40 +0300"},{"content":"We've been in may resorts.

It was our first stay at this resort and I have to admit that it is one of the best resort/casinos in Las Vegas. The rooms were nicely appointed, the beds were comfortable, pillows were super soft and the comforters were suple. Our check-in process went well and the staff at the front desk were courteous and carried themselves in a professional manner. The Encore's pool area is one of the nicer pools in Las Vegas - they provide nice thick and newer towels and you can get poolside service as wait staff is always inquiring if you needed anything at that time. There's a European pool area with a pool bar and gaming tables such as blackjack and craps - so you can cool down at the pool, have a drink at their bar and play some games at your own leisure. I like the accessiblity of the hotel to the Fashion Show mall which is right across the street from it and being at the heart of the strip - accessing other casinos was not a problem. We will definitely be back!","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Roel Lebsack","date":"2015-02-06 00:45:35 +0300"},{"content":"This was our third time in Las Vegas and the best hotel by far,its new stylish and imaculate.Before booking we checked it out on Trip Advisor and read some negative reviews,im sure some people are a bit slow on the uptake.First thing,drinks and food are not cheap but it is a five star hotel which cost millions of dollars to build and to run, this has to be paid for somehow.If you want a beer for a buck and a cheap hot dog go to the places that do that,dont go to a five star resort and expect to live on the cheap.Secondly,thousands stay here every night and tens of thousands pass thru the casino,bars ,restaurants and shops every day.So dont expect the bartender,waitress or hotel manager to remember your name,unless your a high roller its not a personal service type of place.Saying that,the staff were perfect and the food and drinks were as good as it gets.If it takes you 10 or 20 minutes to check in,live with it your not the only person there.Our resort suite was perfect, big bathroom great sitting area with large tv,black out curtains(electric operated) and its true what they say about a Wynn bed.The pool does get a bit packed at the weekend,if your not down there early you wont get a bed.It may be at the quiet end of the strip for some people,but for $15 in a cab you are at Mandalay Bay which is the furthest hotel away on the strip.In summing up,this place is better than the Bellagio,The Venitian,The Paris and the rest,so please dont complain about the price of the food and drinks.When we go back to vegas,we know where we are staying.ps.if you want a quieter room just ask at check in and dont have one that overlooks the pool/night club.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Preston Greenholt","date":"2014-10-21 01:29:56 +0300"},{"content":"The Encore is one of the nicest Hotel that I have stayed. The staff is very friendly. The Hotel rooms are beautiful and cozy. We had the perfect night out we went to Dinner to Switch what a creative looking Restaurant and the food is great, after Dinner we went to see the show LeReve what a show!!!! and after the show we hit the casino. The slots don't payout however, if you go there to have a good time and don't stress over losing a couple of hundred dollars to the slot you be okay. Even though I lost the Casino Host assign to me was wonderful. Overall an excellent choice.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Syble Lueilwitz","date":"2014-04-16 15:43:15 +0300"},{"content":"I would certainly recommend the Encore - The rooms are huge and luxurious and it feels like every detail has been accounted for. For such a highly rated hotel however, the service is relatively poor. I arrived at the hotel in an oversized vehicle and was advised that the Wynn would account for the parking. This wasn't a hassle as the Wynn is next door. However on arrival at the Wynn, we were sitting in our vehicle and told to wait by hotel staff (approx 30 mins) for them only to tell us to go back to the Encore and park their. Cutting the long story short, we wanted a quick check in after a long journey and it took us over an hour overall to be instructed on where to park. Furious at this point, we proceeded to make a complaint at check in only to be told that the manager could not speak to us. When we were finally spoken to, we were given very little compensation at firsat but were eventually given $100 worth of food coupons and late check out... The maid service is poor and we had to phone twice on a 3 night stay and request they clean our rooms. However despite the above, the hotel design and its facilities are amazing and i certainly would recommend it to anyone seeking an opulant Vegas experience. If you do arrive in an RV...GOOD LUCK!!!","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Mr. Cecelia Kohler","date":"2013-01-23 20:13:30 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Miss Zena McKenzie","Daisy Stokes","Thad Lang","Olen Keebler","Madisyn Goyette","Dr. Flo Wuckert","Melisa Huels II","Kyla Luettgen Jr."],"vacancy":false,"description":"Small detached cottage set in stunning country, ideal for birdwatching","alias":"Carbieston Lodge","pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
