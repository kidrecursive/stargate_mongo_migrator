In many ways, it was a groundbreaking and daring engineering and architectural feat when it was constructed in the 1960s, and because of its significance it became Grade II listed. In the 2000s, as the Bullring centre was redeveloped, the Rotunda was thoroughly refurbished into a residential tower with 232 luxury apartments. Those on floors 19 and 20 are available for short term stays via Staying Cool, who operates them. The building is not accessible to the public.","geo":{"lat":52.4783,"lon":-1.89552,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":3519,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Birmingham","state":null}
