The hotel is very isolated and you definitely need a car to get around. The hotel is far from everywhere (i.e., food, towns, shopping, visiting sites) . The room is not bad, but it is very dated with 80s furnitures and the shower is impossible to use. There is a $15/day mandatory resort fee. The beach is nice. The room wasn't cheap either.. we asked for a room with the ocean view and we got a room with lawn view. Next time, I think we will stay somewhere else closer to towns and newer hotels.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":2.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Dr. Barney Davis","date":"2014-03-18 07:45:29 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Walker Erdman","Merlin Willms","Sylvan Tillman","Herta McCullough","Gilbert Runte","Ms. Pascale Heller","Delpha Collins","Dr. Alexys Nader"],"vacancy":true,"description":"154 rooms and 20 suites spread over two buildings dating from the 18th and 19th centuries.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
