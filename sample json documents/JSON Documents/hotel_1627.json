The rooms are not luxurious, but they were clean and functional. The staff was friendly and extremely helpful; they provided directions, suggestions for places to visit, made dinner and taxi reservations for us and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They even offered to make us breakfast before leaving on an early morning flight. Highly recommended.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Summer Hahn V","date":"2012-09-05 08:54:05 +0300"},{"content":"Hotel Curious was a great find! While it does not have the services/frills of a higher star hotel, it does what it does exceedingly well. I stayed in a single room which was small but very clean and had nice decor. The bed was not fancy but I slept well in the room. While only about 50 metres from the Ramblas, there was no noise in the hotel room at all. The street the hotel is on looks a bit dubious but it is well trafficked both during the day and at night and only a few metres from the Ramblas which is always full of people. The hotel is very secure. The reception staff buzz you in and the hotel is small enough they know who you are in no time. As a solo female traveller I had no qualms about my safety either in the hotel or walking to the hotel even in the evenings. The hotel is really nicely maintained and the decor is modern. Free wifi was great and breakfast (continental) was also done well. The real stand out though were the staff. Very friendly and helpful. They printed out my boarding passes for my flights home, booked my taxi for the next morning and, as I was leaving before breakfast is put on, organised a selection for me to have before I left. The one thing I would have liked was an in-room safe which seemed to be standard at almost all the hotels I stayed in while travelling in Spain but was not in this hotel. I didn't have any concerns about the safety of my belongings in the room, I'm just used to using them as an added precaution. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a good value option in the Ramblas area.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Ibrahim Toy","date":"2014-03-09 04:06:48 +0300"},{"content":"We can't recommend Hotel Curious enough for people travelling to Barcelona. The hotel was exactly what we needed for our four day trip. The room was lovely and very clean, and the location is second to none being right in the heart of the city. We found that everything was within walking distance, and so we very quickly felt at home. We must also give a special mention to Sergi, who was so helpful every day with recommendations for good restaurants, sightseeing trips and so on. It was great to see a friendly face at the end of each day. The price of accommodation was a bargain really, and we would certainly stay again if returning to Barcelona!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Franco Gleichner","date":"2015-02-13 03:03:07 +0300"},{"content":"When I travel the ideal trip is one where I have a knowledgeable friend in the city. Stay in this comfortable little hotel 1 block off La Rambla and Mateo, the daytime manager/ receptionist is that friend instantly. The local knowledge he cheerfully shares in 5 going on 6 languages is priceless. I have yet to meet the Ritz Carlton concierge who can match his gracious assistance. The rooms are bright and clean. You are smaller than I and I could shower with a bit if caution. Hot water galore, firm mattress, 2 blocks to La Boqueria and Mateo all for a modest price. Want to spend more? OK but you won't get better value. Location or Mate for your money!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Ike Smitham","date":"2014-07-29 23:47:50 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Jorge Romaguera","Katelyn Gutmann","Mrs. Elenor Hermiston"],"vacancy":true,"description":"31 room hotel","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":false,"free_parking":true}
