The rooms were excellent, other than the bathroom being a touch on the small side, but by far not enough to drag it down. The pool area and 2 restaurants were excellent, although we never used the pool, the area looked in top shape. We were barely 200 yards from hotel to ocean and less than 1/2 mile to some very good local places to eat. All in all this stay was wonderful and I would definitely stay here again and recommend anyone else stay here. Also, forgot to mention, it was by far the most comfortable bed and pillows I've ever slept on.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Odessa Price","date":"2015-11-10 12:40:36 +0300"},{"content":"Everything about this hotel was great. I don't have one complaint after staying there 8 nights. Right from check-in to check-out the staff was courteous and helpful.The parking was free. The room was well-cleaned everyday. The beds were amazingly comfortable. From the large HD tv to the enjoyable lanai, the room setup was super comfortable. Bike rental was easy and there was always a bike free. The beach (Charley Young) was our favourite is basically right across the street. Each day we got fresh beach towels from the reception. Poolside live music seemed to be daily around 5 pm. Kihei is a quaint village/town and everything seemed relaxed yet well-run.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Rolando Bartoletti","date":"2012-05-16 20:26:02 +0300"},{"content":"Hotel is in a great location for getting to various locations on the island. There are many great aspects to this hotel. The most important thing to remember is that this is not a resort, this is a hotel. So, certain amenities are not available. HOTEL Hotel lobby is beautiful and open. Nicely appointed furniture, very clean, and easy to access driveway and parking. Hotel fees are $17.50 a day per room. I saw on Expedia that it said $15.00, but that's incorrect as of January 2011. Hotel Service Associates: Absolutely professional. Wonderful customer service and always friendly. Pool: Very clean. Small, but nice and usually enough chairs available. 2 spa options and 1 pool. Nice pool bar with eating tables. Bathroom was very clean. The only issue was that there were people from outside of the hotel that were allowed to use the pool because the security on the grounds doesnâ€™t have directions from management to not allow non-guests to use the pool. We saw one particular situation where a guest was upset over a non-guestâ€™s behavior. ***Be aware, not everyone at the pool and bar are paying patrons to the hotel.*** Bike Rentals: you can rent 10 speed and beach cruisers for free (this is included in the $17.50 per day). Rooms: Very clean. Odd numbered rooms have a great views of the mountains and the ocean. Our room had a beautiful sunrise and sunset view. We had a remodeled suit which was large, had a mini kitchenette area, 2 flat screen televisions, couch in the living room, king bed in the bedroom, and 2 sliding doors. Large bathroom with great water pressure. Bathroom has a mirror that does not fog up while taking a shower. It leaves the middle area on the mirror unfogged which was great! Bathtub side was a bit high (especially if you're short), so watch your shins. Parking: Ample parking. Well lit and safe. Cafe O'le was a great lunch spot and close to the hotel after you get off the plane and wait for your room. Maui Coffee was excellent and close to the hotel. 4 Seasons Hotel has great restaurants. Ferraro's was excellent.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Leonel Jewess","date":"2015-03-09 09:59:16 +0300"},{"content":"We had a a two-bed unit (#255). The room was small, and the bathroom was very small. In fact, there was barely enough space to get into the bathroom since it had an inward-opening door and there was just enough space for a person to stand to allow the door to close. The air conditioner in our room was very loud. Otherwise, the room was nice. It had high-quality bedding, high-quality towels, nice furniture and a flat-screen TV. I especially liked the electricity outlets at the bottom of the light units, providing plenty of outlets to recharge all electronics. The staff was friendly. The pool is basic compared to some of the larger resorts. There is a bar/cabana next to the pool. I did not go to the beach, but it is a somewhat long walk due to the length of the Maui Coast Hotel and the street crossing. The hotel is on the main Kihei strip, with plenty of restaurants and stores within walking distance.","ratings":{"Overall":4.0},"author":"Evert Harber","date":"2014-06-27 20:21:11 +0300"},{"content":"We spent our first week in Maui here and would return. Check in was a breeze, the room excellent, beds very comfy, plenty of linens. The pool and hot tub were spotless, there was pool side entertainment at night along with a bar and restaurant. We were able to book all of our tours on sight, they were very helpful with the planning of our 2 weeks there. Highly recommend, but do shop around for the price, I found this place for $109.00 a night when most travel sights were charging a lot more, including the hotel site.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Waino Brekke Sr.","date":"2014-08-11 07:25:07 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed at the Maui Coast Hotel for our honeymoon in mid July. This place looked like the nicest place in the immediate area. The hotel was very clean and well maintained. It was pretty obvious that the hotel had recently been renovated. The bed was very comfortable. We had a small outdoor space that had a partial view of the ocean when you looked out and to the side. The service was great. Everyone was very friendly. We were provided a complimentary bottle of wine for our honeymoon. The only downside for us was the location. It was an ok location, but not the best. We felt like we were a southern California beach town. We were able to easily walk across the street and to the beach in just a couple minutes. Overall, we liked the hotel and would stay there again. The price can't be beat for what we got. May comparable places we looked at were in the $300s+ a night. Those locations may be better, but not the hotels themselves.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Marjorie Osinski","date":"2015-09-28 16:59:30 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Shane Lockman","Miss Devan West","Mabel Kulas","Rosanna Anderson Jr."],"vacancy":false,"description":"Decorated in brown and beige, this Mercure tries to make the most out of a historic ''immeuble'', with all the necessary compromises - some bedrooms are smaller than their en-suite bathrooms!","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
