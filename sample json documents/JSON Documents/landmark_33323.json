If you grew up in Whittier in the '80s, your older brother took you on rides on this winding, (relatively) desolate boulevard on weekends. He further scared you by claiming that skinheads and Satanists met here on Fridays nights--just about the time you hit that first turn.  Suburban legends aside, it can be scary to drive on, especially at night in the rain. To get here from Uptown, take Hadley Street east, turn left onto Painter Avenue, and turn right onto Beverly Boulevard. Beverly turns into Turnbull Canyon Road.  The true test of local-area back roads is whether you're able, after driving the length of Turnbull Canyon, to return to Whittier without making a U-turn, taking the freeway, or using Hacienda Boulevard.","geo":{"lat":33.993651,"lon":-118.013592,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":33323,"country":"United States","city":"Whittier","state":"California"}
