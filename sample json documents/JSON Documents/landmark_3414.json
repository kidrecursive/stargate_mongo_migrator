Since opening in 1974, Mr. Chow has remained a culinary heavyweight in the pantheon of Los Angeles dining, not too mention the enduring allure it has for the A-list. Austere in design, with trademark black and white checkerboard floor and tiny tables bunched close together, the dining room is always bustling, still channeling the 'caf√© society' vibe restaurant founder Michael Chow instilled in the place from when it opened. There are now Mr. Chow restaurants in London, New York, and coming soon, Las Vegas. Do try the Drunken Fish.","geo":{"lat":34.068085,"lon":-118.403333,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":3414,"country":"United States","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"California"}
