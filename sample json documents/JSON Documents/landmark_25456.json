A charming, crowded, locally known date restaurant, L'Osteria has a line out the door after 5PM, so arrive early.  The small semi-surly staff cooks up wonderful, affordably-priced dishes in the kitchen's one oven, so things can take a little while... specials on the menu: the roast pork, baked penne, and salmon carpaccio are favorites. Excellent Italian wine selection by the glass and bottle. Cannot seat more than 4 in a party.","geo":{"lat":37.7997,"lon":-122.4096,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":25456,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
