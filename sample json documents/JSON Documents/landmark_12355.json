Now owned and operated by English Heritage, most of the well-preserved house and grounds are open to visitors year-round. Visitors planning to visit both Osborne House and Carisbrooke Castle should consider becoming members of English Heritage; it can work out cheaper than buying individual tickets for family groups and allows free access to all other English Heritage properities for the rest of the year.","geo":{"lat":50.74893,"lon":-1.27257,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":12355,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"East Cowes","state":null}
