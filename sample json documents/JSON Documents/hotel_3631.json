Although it was packed full for the AWP conference, the staff could not have been more courteous and helpful. I was fortunate enough to to receive an upgrade to the executive level and wow! what a treat! Breakfast and evening snacks were very good. But what made the experience even better was Ernest who worked the breakfast shift. He was everywhere with a smile and an exceptional professional attitude towards customer service. The hotel itself is historic and lovely and very well-maintained. I am not typically a fan of large downtown conventions hotels but I plan to return to The Palmer House on my next visit to Chicago!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Torrance Morar","date":"2014-02-10 23:22:50 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Hillard Greenfelder DVM","Rafaela Becker","Lorenza Murazik","Ross Stokes","Augustine Wintheiser","Coleman Greenholt","Flavio Romaguera","Zachariah Gislason"],"vacancy":false,"description":"An old Holiday Inn in an office/commercial area of the centre","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":true}
