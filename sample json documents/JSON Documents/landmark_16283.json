Built in the early 18th century, the house remains much as it was when Darwin lived here. The rooms on the ground floor have been furnished to reflect the domestic life of the family and the first floor offers an interactive exhibition on his life, his research and his discoveries. English Heritage has restored the gardens to their appearance in Darwin's time.","geo":{"lat":51.333148,"lon":0.054262,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16283,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Downe","state":null}
