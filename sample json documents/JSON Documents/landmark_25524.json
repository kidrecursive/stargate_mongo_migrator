Its &quot;Beaux-Arts&quot; dome (the fifth largest in the world) was modeled after that of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, Italy.  The building itself is huge, 393 feet long, by 273 feet wide, and 307 feet high &mdash; occupying a full two blocks of San Francisco's downtown real estate. It is considered by many admirers to be the most impressive building in the city.  Inside, it features a large rotunda with a grandiose staircase leading up to the second floor.  The walls are adorned with oak paneling and the ceilings with crystal chandeliers.  City Hall is the site of much history &mdash; In 1954 Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe wed here. In 1978, Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were assassinated here.","geo":{"lat":37.7793,"lon":-122.4193,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25524,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
