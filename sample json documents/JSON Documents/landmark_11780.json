The outdoor area is extraordinarily nice but fills early, while the inside of the bar is spacious but gets crowded in the evenings.  Prices are reasonable given the location and decor, with beers from $5 per pint and food starting around $8.","geo":{"lat":34.09773,"lon":-118.332739,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":11780,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
