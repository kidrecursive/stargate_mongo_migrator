They make sustainability farmed Rhone-style wines and offer one of the few free tastings left in the region. They have ancient vine wines, too, which date back to the 1800s. Family friendly tastings, as there is a carp pond where kids can feet the fish, a Missions Museum talking about the history of missions in California, and two adorable burros named Pudding & Fancy.
