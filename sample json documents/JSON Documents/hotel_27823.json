Furniture is like dorm-room style with a couch that was on a metal frame with stained removable cushions. No amenities. No services. No wireless Internet in the rooms (only the lobby). Hotel was relatively safe and room was clean. Bed was cheap. No TV in the bedroom -- only the living room. Would not want to stay there again.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Marilyne Romaguera","date":"2014-05-06 14:38:04 +0300"},{"content":"We didn't get the room that we requested but we did get a room just as nice. They didn't tell us we were getting a different room, they just hoped we wouldn't complain. I requested a 2-room condo with 4 queen beds, I was given a 2-room condo with one queen bed and 2 sets of bunk beds. Good thing it was just a bunch of young college friends and not older couples; twin bunk beds don't usually work for older couples. Most of the hallways were under construction. The rooms in each condo were on the small side as well as the kitchen. The living room was nice with leather couches and a balcony. Dining room had pretty chairs. Be careful when walking out to the balcony though the sliding glass door has a 3inch lip that i tripped on walking out to the balcony. I don't know if that is on all rooms, but it was in mine.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":2.0},"author":"Aliza Rau","date":"2015-01-29 18:03:41 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Mr. Ervin Gulgowski","Tanya DuBuque","Michele Bayer","Idell Kub","Sasha Christiansen","Allison Koch DDS","Muhammad O'Keefe II"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Registered on the National Register of Historic Places, Swiss Hotel is in a great location on the Plaza. A small group of guest rooms overlook the Plaza above an Italian restaurant and bar. Located in the heart of the town and near several bars, the inn can attract street noise in the late evenings, including rowdy tourists heading back to their hotels after a long day (and night) of wine country drinking.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":false,"free_parking":true}
