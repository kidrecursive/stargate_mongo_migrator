Not much is left of its ruined '''castle''' besides crumbling walls. Still, climbing up the stairs to reach the platforms 90 metres above Nice is well worth the view. There is also a lift (''ascenseur'') which will take you three quarters of the way up. Be aware that the castle hill park closes at around sunset. Expect to be escorted outside if you stay longer.","geo":{"lat":43.69577,"lon":7.28014,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":20405,"country":"France","city":"Nice","state":"Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur","image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Cimeti%C3%A8re_Colline_du_Ch%C3%A2teau_Nice.JPG"}
