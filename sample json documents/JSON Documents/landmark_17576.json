Offering what may be the best vista point in the area, this is a great spot for walking and gazing out at the deep blue water, boats and Marina.  The park offers waterside picnic tables, lawn areas, and covered picnic areas with barbeque grills.  It's a popular  viewing area for the annual December [http://mdrboatparade.org/ Marina del Rey Holiday Boat Parade]. During the summer months, free live outdoor concerts by the water in Chace Park are not to be missed.  On select Thursdays, (classical music with full symphony orchestra) and Saturdays (easy listening pop) concerts begin at 7PM and last about 2 hours.  Seating is first-come, first-serve on the green (many bring their own low lawn chairs or blankets to sit on), and many spectactors pack picnics to enjoy before the concert; bring a jacket or sweater to stay comfortable by the water in the evening. Parking for the park activities is in pay lots only located a block or two from the park.","geo":{"lat":33.97812,"lon":-118.44317,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":17576,"country":"United States","city":"Marina del Rey","state":"California"}
