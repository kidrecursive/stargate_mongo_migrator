The pub, which took its name from a local aristocrat, the Earl of Fitzroy, in turn inspired the name of the surrounding area of Bloomsbury, Fitzrovia, and was a popular drinking place for BBC broadcasters (including George Orwell) following the Second World War. A very friendly pub, with nice outdoor seating in summer. | image=Fitzroy Tavern - Fitzrovia - W1.jpg","geo":{"lat":51.5186,"lon":-0.1347,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":16037,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Fitzroy_Tavern_-_Fitzrovia_-_W1.jpg"}
