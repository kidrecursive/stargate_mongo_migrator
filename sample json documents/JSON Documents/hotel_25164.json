The rooms were cute, and they obviously make an attempt to keep them as up to date as possible on a limited budget. The hosts are really helpful, and the breakfast on the terrace is brilliant - they make sure you have enough to eat, and the views over the Sea of Marmara make it difficult to want to leave the hotel. Definitely recommend this to others.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Dr. Rowan Wiegand","date":"2013-10-17 10:53:10 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Miss Silas Champlin","Einar Kautzer","Alverta Beatty","Bailey Rath","Audrey Bashirian"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Complimentary airport shuttle, extensive amenities and friendly staff.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":false,"free_parking":false}
