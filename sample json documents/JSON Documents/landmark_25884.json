They have fries, but gravy is not an option, so if you're from Canada, skip it. They do have wireless, however, but you have to ask. Sandwich is worth the cost of internet, if you want to evaluate things in that way. The &quot;space&quot; is nice too. Their toilet is pretty clean, though it plays French instructional tapes, the contents of which include children and the directions to the toilet, which may be unsettling (si vous parlez francais).","geo":{"lat":37.7635,"lon":-122.422,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":25884,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
