If I had known (and if there was vacancies) I would have stayed all week! It was awesome...Nothing like it! I stayed in Cottage D, which was over the water even at low tide. When the tide was up, you could see surfers riding waves right by your room as you sat in the living room. The sound and feel of the waves crashing beneath you are just the coolest most relaxing thing ever. When I do return, I will want that same cottage. A&B are the 2 on the end, but you get more privacy from the public pier on the end. Another great feature is your car is parked right alongside your cottage (easy for loading/unloading!) The staff was amazingly friendly, and has your safety and privacy priority! Thankyou Randy for all your helpful tips on tours, eateries, and directions. I will look fwd to becoming a regular here as I know many people have!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Barrett Collier","date":"2014-07-03 01:44:31 +0300"},{"content":"Staying at this place is a must!

So I couldn't spend as much time on my own deck as I would have liked and had to close my windows on that side to keep out the smell. Location can't be beat and the rooms were really cozy and clean. I'll be back and the next time I'll complain to the management about the smokers if necessary!","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Lorine Schaden","date":"2015-10-31 19:27:31 +0300"},{"content":"I was invited to tag along with some friends that were staying at the Crystal Pier for a few days and I am so glad I did. The location is amazing, the cottages are nicely furnished and the sunsets from the pier are spectacular. A few negatives; we were given cottage 22 which appears to be the â€œruntâ€� of the cottages. It didnâ€™t have a futon as the other cottages have but it did have two twin size roll out beds. We had our own patio but it was so small that it only contained one lounge chair and a small round table with two (not four) patio chairs and no umbrella. The kitchen was so small that we couldnâ€™t reach the microwave unless we moved the dining chairs away from the table. Another issue was that none of the outlets in the kitchen worked except the one the toaster and coffee pot were already plugged into. From what I could see of the other cottages, ours appeared quite a bit smaller. We were disappointed that we didnâ€™t have a French door as the other cottages did and we had to park a good distance from our front door and not in front of the cottage as other guests could. The parking was a nightmare too. You are only allowed one assigned parking spot per cottage and you get locked in by all the other cars lined up bumper to bumper. The front desk clerk was grumpy about us driving through the gate before we got a key but no one was outside to tell us not to. She was less than friendly at check in. Youâ€™d think the front desk staff would be a little nicer and more professional for the amount of money you pay to stay there. The bathroom was fine and the shower had great water pressure. We brought lots of food with us and even made a big dinner one night. The kitchen did have all the basic necessities (pots, pans, dishes & utensils). You can also get a barbeque grill from the front desk (you provide the charcoal). All in all, it was a fabulous stay. I will definitely return but wonâ€™t stay in Cottage 22 again. I donâ€™t think it warrants the same rate as the other larger 1 bedroom units. There are also tons of shops and restaurants very close. I recommend visiting Pangaea for a cool shopping experience but make sure you have enough time to see everything in this large and very diverse store. Also, try Bustamanteâ€™s on Garnet Ave. We had a fantastic breakfast/lunch. Good selection on the menu; Mexican cuisine, plus omelets, pancakes, Belgium waffles, you name it. All very good food made from scratch. Good sized servings and each meal came with a fruit cup to start. Also, Edgar is the best waiter/host you can ask for. He went out of his way to make sure we had a great time and everyone at the table was happy. Be careful not to park on Garnet Street overnight though. I got a $40 ticket for being there between 3am â€“ 6am Tuesday morning when the street sweeper came around.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":2.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":3.0},"author":"Ashly O'Hara","date":"2012-02-15 05:01:06 +0300"},{"content":"My mother-in-law used to stay at this property many years ago. The luster has obviously faded. While the physical property is interesting, this part of San Diego is a bit dumpy, unless you like homeless people sleeping all around you while you are on vacation at the beach. But the reall problem is the staff. To say they are below the standard for the hoteling world is an understandment. If I owned this place, they would all be replaced. It was extraordinary to have every person who I had an encounter with to have such a poor disposition. Beware of this place!","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":2.0,"Check in / front desk":1.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":2.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Isaias Jaskolski","date":"2013-02-07 10:25:36 +0300"},{"content":"We have traveled extensively, and can find no better place to relax and enjoy the company of our family but at the Crystal Pier. Contrary to a few (minority) of reviewers that rate the staff as uncourteous, we have always found the staff to be very accomodating and outstanding in their service to customers. The only thing I can think of is that these folks are writing poor reviews to \"keep others\" away and have the pier to themselves! It is true that the pier is quite popular and it is very difficult to get a reservation, but that all goes with being an outstanding property. I graciously give the Pier 5 STARS and recommend it to all!","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Newell Reilly","date":"2013-11-25 15:39:01 +0300"},{"content":"For people interested in more than Sea World who like to explore on foot, this hotel is centrally located and offers great value. It is situated at the start of the bars, restaurants, and entertainment on gentrified 5th Ave., a stone’s throw from the Westfield Horton Shopping Plaza where tour buses stop. Walking a bit further brings you to the convention center and touristy waterfront. Taxis to must-visit Balboa Park are around $10. We were able to book a very large top floor suite for a weekday rate of less than $200 per night. The small staff who rotate through the front desk were friendly and in our case exceptionally helpful. The hotel’s self-serve breakfast is modest but provided on the roof top (part of which is under cover) where the view more than compensates. We found this historic property to be clean and well maintained… very easy to recommend.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Nico Deckow","date":"2014-05-23 10:15:02 +0300"}],"public_likes":[],"vacancy":false,"description":"All the rooms are different with old-style charm.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
