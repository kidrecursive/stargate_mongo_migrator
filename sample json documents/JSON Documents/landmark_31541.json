The school began in the truest pioneering fashion.  After being denied requested funds from San Bernardino County, the inhabitants of the surrounding area decided to take matters into their own hands. Working solely on the assistance and altruism of the community, the one-room schoolhouse was born, originally hosting eight students, hailing from different corners of the Morongo Basin. The Schoolhouse is now home to a museum and gift shop operated by the Twentynine Palms Historical Society. Exhibits center around the groups that were important to the history of the Twentynine Palms area: the Native Americans, miners, cattlemen, homesteaders, and military.","geo":{"lat":34.131407,"lon":-116.04738,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":31541,"country":"United States","city":"Twentynine Palms","state":"California"}
