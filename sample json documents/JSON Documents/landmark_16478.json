Adrian Jones' chariot statue on the top, &quot;Peace descending on the Quadriga of War&quot;, was added in 1912.  The original equestrian statue, added in 1846, was widely disliked and now stands in [[Aldershot]].  The arch is now owned by English Heritage and is open to the public: it contains exhibits about the arch and English history, while the view from the top is quite impressive.  | image=Wellington-Arch.JPG","geo":{"lat":51.5025,"lon":-0.1508,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16478,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Wellington-Arch.JPG"}
