It is, however, worth stopping to have a look around you when you're 'in town', as the locals say. As the most complete example of a post-war reconstruction in the UK, this is a historically and architecturally significant district. It was planned by none other than Patrick Abercrombie, who also redesigned Hong Kong, and some of the buildings boast Thomas Tait as their architect. With a modern, almost American look, it was, in the words of Professor Jeremy Gould, 'an egalitarian grid, spacious, airy, uncomplicated, accessible and gapingly open to all...the architecture of the future â€“ clean, bright, democratic and, most of all, optimistic.' Some of the best examples of the 1950s style are found along the main axis of Royal Parade and Armada Way, including the Royal Bank of Scotland building, the Pearl Assurance House and the former Co-Op Building at Derry's Cross.","geo":{"lat":50.3702,"lon":-4.1425,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":22547,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Plymouth","state":null}
