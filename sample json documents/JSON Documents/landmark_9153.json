Whether you want just a cuppa, or a sandwich, a light snack, or a delicious home cooked meal. Beaches Diner is a family diner, with dedicated menus for young and old; and not just chips! Children can enjoy healthy options with Pasta and Mashed, or Baked potatoes, from their own menu, and fresh carrots and other vegetables are often available. Local Produce we like to source good quality local foods and our list of suppliers is aimed to be within fifteen miles of the diner. It is only occasionally that we have to stray outside of this aim. The ‘Best Breakfast in Town’ is what our local customers tell us; and for that we are grateful and very proud. ‘Good food’ and ‘Good value for money’ are other positive comments and compliments that we receive; and again we are grateful and appreciative of this reputation. There is a chef’s special most days. Very convenient for ferry or train travellers.","geo":{"lat":52.0027,"lon":-4.9933,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":9153,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Goodwick","state":null}
