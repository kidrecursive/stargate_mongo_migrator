The unmistakable facade is inspired by Citroen's chevron logo, and the building has no less than seven storeys exhibiting Citroen's past, present and future, including iconic classics, the concept cars and winning sportscars from its many decades of history, and of course the current lineup. The interior is just as spectacular and unique as the exterior and well worth a visit.","geo":{"lat":48.87011,"lon":2.30774,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"buy","type":"landmark","id":21820,"country":"France","city":"Paris","state":"ÃŽle-de-France"}
