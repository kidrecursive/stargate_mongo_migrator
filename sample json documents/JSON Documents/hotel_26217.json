This hotel is a nice property. They have plenty of parking, well maintained grounds, nice front desk staff, a gift shop that unexpectedly had the milk I needed for my baby. The pools was clean and warm, the room was larger than others in the area- it was clean and nicely furnished. For the price you get much more than other area hotels. I like the location the most. It is close enough to Disney, yet far enough away from the crazy hype of Rt.192. The pool closes at 11pm and the security keeps things nice and quiet. I will return again for sure.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Odell Kuphal","date":"2015-01-31 02:35:01 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Mr. Valentina Mueller","Mr. Rita Bins","Kianna Shanahan","Yasmin Lesch","Gordon Hyatt","Esperanza Bogan","Whitney Ankunding","Alfonzo Doyle"],"vacancy":false,"description":"A classic hotel overlooking Powell Street.
