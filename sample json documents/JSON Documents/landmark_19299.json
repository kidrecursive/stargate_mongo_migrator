It is thought to be the final resting place of St Milburga, whose bones were discovered during restoration work in 1101. Wenlock Priory is the perfect place to sit on a warm, mid-summer day and relax. The delightful grounds contain a well groomed collection of topiary.","geo":{"lat":52.597922,"lon":-2.555457,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":19299,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Much Wenlock","state":null}
