The Queen travels by carriage down The Mall from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade, where she inspects the troops and then entire Household Division performs a march past the Queen as she receives their salute. Tickets to Horse Guards Parade are awarded by ballot but the parade along the rest of the route can be watched for free.  Up to three tickets can be requested by sending a letter (this is by post only), enclosing a self-addressed envelope, to the Brigade Major of the Headquarters Household Division, in January or February; these will be entered into the ballot and those chosen will be sent offer letters which contain payment details.  Those without a ticket can get their best view by standing on The Mall, along the edge of the parade, or on the edge of St James's Park by Horse Guards Parade.
