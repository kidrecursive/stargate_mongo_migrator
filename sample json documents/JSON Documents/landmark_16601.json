Famous for their 'French Dip' sandwiches dipped in au jus ($4.90), but the real reason to go is the atmosphere and the pastrami &mdash; the joint opened in 1908 and the menu still features things like pickled eggs and pig's feet. Coffee is ten cents a cup, but their 60-cent lemonade is even more popular. Expect to line up at any time and the place is mobbed on the nights of Lakers and Dodgers games.","geo":{"lat":34.059657,"lon":-118.236953,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":16601,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
