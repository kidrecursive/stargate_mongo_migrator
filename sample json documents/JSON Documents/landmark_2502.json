All that is left on the surface now are a complete ring of city walls, the amphitheater and an little medieval church. Away from the rivers that have dictated the area demographics, Silchester is about as isolated a place as you will find in south-east England; on a spring weekday you are likely to find yourself sharing the ruins only with cows. Open every day sunrise-sunset.","geo":{"lat":51.356481,"lon":-1.077628,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":2502,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Hampshire","state":null}
