{"title":"San Francisco/Chinatown-North Beach","name":"Filbert Steps","alt":null,"address":null,"directions":null,"phone":null,"tollfree":null,"email":null,"url":null,"hours":null,"image":null,"price":null,"content":"The Filbert Steps are the part of Filbert Street that runs between Battery Street and Telegraph Hill Boulevard in North Beach. The steps end next to Coit Tower, and offer a scenic &mdash; though some what strenuous &mdash; route for visitors of the tower. In fact, following the steps is at times faster than driving to Coit Tower due to the high demand for relatively few parking spots near the site.  Visitors of the steps will see public gardens, stylish homes and views of North Beach and the bay; if a path is not gated or specifically signed with &quot;No Trespassing,&quot; then it is most likely public. Also, it pays to be adventurous: some of the best gardens and views are off the stairs. Finally, there is more than one way up and down; if you make a round trip you should find a new route for the return leg. Just avoid private property.","geo":{"lat":37.8019,"lon":-122.405,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25396,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
