The deal where you pick 5 options from the Mezze menu for £15 and get a bowl of chips thrown in is a great option for a value lunch for two. You might find it hard to resist spending another couple of pounds on one of the broad range of home baked cakes to follow it though - if you can fit one in. Free WiFi and even the gent’s toilets have interesting decor. It's probably a good thing they don't have rooms or you'd never want to leave!","geo":{"lat":55.962507,"lon":-3.178538,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":8572,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Edinburgh","state":null}
