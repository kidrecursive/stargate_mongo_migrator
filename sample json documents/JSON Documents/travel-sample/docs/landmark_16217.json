Beers are often served in pewter tankards for the extra traditional touch. Six rooms are available as well for those who want to sleep where they drink (or just near the Barbican). Great atmosphere but it can be a little more expensive than average, especially the food and lodging.","geo":{"lat":51.5204,"lon":-0.1007,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":16217,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null}
