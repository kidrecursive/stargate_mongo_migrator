The sign outside says that they have the best Philly-cheese steaks in the city... almost certainly not true, but with its fresh ingredients, itâ€™s pretty good nonetheless.  They also do a very good burger at a reasonable price.  Friendly staff and open late to cater to the party crowd.","geo":{"lat":37.7986,"lon":-122.4074,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":25447,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
