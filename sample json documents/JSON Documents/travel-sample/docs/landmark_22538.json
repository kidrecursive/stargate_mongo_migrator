While it used to ecompass much of Marina del Rey, Playa del Rey and Venice, today the area is much smaller, with much of it in a degraded state pending future restoration. The freshwater portion of the wetlands, located along Jefferson and Lincoln boulevards, features a walking path and is home to all manner of waterfowl. The saltwater portion of the wetlands is closed to the public on most days, but tours are offered on the second weekend of every month (check the Friends of the Wetlands calendar for times, park behind Gordon's Market at 303 Culver Blvd).","geo":{"lat":33.96677,"lon":-118.43893,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":22538,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
