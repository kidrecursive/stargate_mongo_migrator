All was perfect, much better than we had expected! The room is so cozy, very well decorated.. and the system of non check-in and not check-out works cool! It is a great idea! It makes you feel like home! Besides, It is placed in a very well-comunicated neighbourhood (the T), and you have all the facilites that you desire near.. Prudential Center is 3 min on foot.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Boris Kessler","date":"2013-11-03 06:11:01 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Milford Trantow","Margarete Fahey","Amalia Satterfield","Mr. Abby Corwin","Mr. Bernice Schmidt","Florence Bailey","Mandy O'Keefe","Leanna Purdy"],"vacancy":false,"description":"A rejuvenated 1960s Motor Inn.
