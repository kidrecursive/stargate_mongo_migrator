One of the few missions established ''after'' there had been significant development in the region. The Convento building (built in 1822) is apparently the largest adobe structure in California. Following a 1971 earthquake, the mission was restored in 1974. Bob Hope is buried in the memorial garden next to the church, and in the adjacent cemetery are buried Richie Valens and many other Hollywood celebrities who were Catholic.","geo":{"lat":34.273336,"lon":-118.461245,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":37508,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
