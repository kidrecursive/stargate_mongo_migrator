Don't look for calicos for your quilting project: this is the land of luxury fabrics for faking couture at home. If you've ever wanted to make a cheap sweater look expensive by adding deluxe buttons, head straight for the third floor, where 30,000 styles await your approval (don't even think of touching a button - the clerks do that). Britex is also notable for selling remnants that are big enough for a real project.","geo":{"lat":37.7878,"lon":-122.4057,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"buy","type":"landmark","id":26185,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
