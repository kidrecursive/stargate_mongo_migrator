The rows of perfectly aligned headstones against the immaculate, emerald green lawn convey an unforgettable feeling of peace and tranquility. The beaches can be viewed from the bluffs above, and there is a path down to the beach. On the Walls of the Missing in a semicircular garden on the east side of the memorial are inscribed 1,557 names. Rosettes mark the names of those since recovered and identified.","geo":{"lat":49.3591555,"lon":-0.85316111,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":7355,"country":"France","city":"Colleville-sur-Mer","state":"Basse-Normandie"}
