It is the single largest public library in the UK and one of the largest in the whole of Europe. The project, which involved years of planning and preparation and a major architectural contest, was hailed as the cornerstone of Birmingham's urban revival. The building was designed by the Dutch firm Mecanoo architecten, and took four years to be completed. It includes an intricate facade decoration, despite the very simple form of the building, as well as a number of innovative sustainable solutions.","geo":{"lat":52.47972,"lon":-1.90846,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":3514,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Birmingham","state":null}
