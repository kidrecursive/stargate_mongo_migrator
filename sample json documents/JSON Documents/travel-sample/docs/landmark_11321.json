From Hayfield, the nearest point to the hill with public parking is '''Bowden Bridge Car Park''' (20 spaces; £3.50 per day as of 2013) on Kinder Road about a mile east of the village centre. There is a plaque here commemorating the Mass Trespass. The main focus of most hikes is '''Kinder Downfall''' (a 30-metre waterfall, impressive in spate but little more than a trickle most of the time). A visit to the Downfall requires a minimum walk of 6 miles (around 3 miles each way) from Bowden Bridge with around 400m of ascent over sometimes rough ground; reasonable fitness is required, and inexperienced hillwalkers should not attempt the trip during bad weather. The two most common routes to the Kinder plateau, which combine to form a circular route of around 7½ miles from Bowden Bridge, are via Kinder Reservoir and William Clough, or via Tunstead Clough Farm and Kinderlow End.","geo":{"lat":53.3794,"lon":-1.9283,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":11321,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Derbyshire","state":null}
