At a right hand bend, turn left down the steep Bells Brae. Alternatively follow the Water of Leith Walkway upstream from Stockbridge.","phone":null,"tollfree":null,"email":null,"url":"http://deanvillage.org/","hours":null,"image":null,"price":null,"content":"Dating back to the 12th century, the Dean Village was home to the flour mills that fed Edinburgh for centuries, powered by the Water of Leith which flows right through the village. &quot;Dean&quot; or &quot;Dene&quot; means a steep valley, and this situation means that the village is protected from the noise of the City, despite being so close to the city centre. Walk down Miller Row to see the full splendour of Thomas Telford's ''Dean Bridge'', which seems relatively mundane when crossing it on Queensferry Street. There are information boards dotted around the village giving information about the different buildings, and the history of the village and the milling industry that once thrived here.","geo":{"lat":55.95228,"lon":-3.2182,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":8581,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Edinburgh","state":null}
