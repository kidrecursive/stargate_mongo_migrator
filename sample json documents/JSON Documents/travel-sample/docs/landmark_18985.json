It has since been rededicated to those who fell in all past wars. The climb up to the Memorial is well worth the effort as on a clear day it offers a magnificent 360-degree panorama of the surrounding countryside. To the east the [[Church_Stretton|Shropshire Hills]] can be seen very clearly, while to the west, all the major mountain groups of Mid- and North-Wales can be seen, from [[Aberystwyth|Pumlumon]] to the south-west, [[Tywyn#Outdoor_Pursuits|Cadair Idris]] to the west, the [[Bala|Arans]] and [[Snowdonia_National_Park#Main_Mountain_Groups|Snowdon]] (over 50 miles away!) to the north-west and the Berwyns in the north.","geo":{"lat":52.55357,"lon":-3.157743,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":18985,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Powys","state":null}
