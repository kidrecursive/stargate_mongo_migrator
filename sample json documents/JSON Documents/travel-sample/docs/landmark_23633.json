{"title":"Reading (England)","name":"Silchester Roman Town","alt":null,"address":null,"directions":"8 miles south east of Reading; grid reference SU643624","phone":null,"tollfree":null,"email":null,"url":"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/silchester-roman-city-walls-and-amphitheatre/","hours":"Open every day sunrise-sunset","image":null,"price":"Free","content":"Known to the Romans as Calleva Atrebatum, the town was abandoned after the Roman era which means that much of the archeology remains. All that is left on the surface now are a complete ring of city walls and the amphitheater. Nearby is an attractive little mediaeval church. Away from the rivers that have dictated the area demographics, Calleva Atrebatum is about as isolated a place as you will find in south-east England; on a spring weekday you are likely to find yourself sharing the ruins only with cows. Parts of the walls are on private land with no public access. Unfortunately there is no bus service between Reading and the site. You can take the train to Bramley and follow the Silchester Trail [http://www.hants.gov.uk/rh/walking/silchester-trail.pdf] from there. Alternatively, take the no.2 bus from Reading to Mortimer, and walk from there along quiet lanes and footpaths (about 3.5&nbsp;km (2.2&nbsp;mi) - you may need a map to find the way). There is some car parking space at the church and a larger car park at grid ref. SU637629. The site is some distance away from the modern village of Silchester.","geo":{"lat":51.356481,"lon":-1.077628,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":23633,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Hampshire","state":null}
