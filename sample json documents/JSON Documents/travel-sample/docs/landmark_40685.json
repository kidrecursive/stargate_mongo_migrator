This property is their tasting room, but it's unlike any other in Wine Country - you think you've entered a Tuscan town or visited Epcot's Italy. Try their wines, and also grab lunch or snacks. You can do a formal tasting, get just glasses, or buy bottles and enjoy them in the piazza. A family friendly experience - live music is frequent, shops are onsite, including a gelato shop. Be sure to check out the caged birds.","geo":{"lat":38.417445,"lon":-122.550203,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":40685,"country":"United States","city":"Kenwood","state":"California"}
