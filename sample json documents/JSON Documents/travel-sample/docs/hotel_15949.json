The place was just beautiful. People were so friendly and kind. They made you feel like one big family. We went to the Ritz Carlton to check it out and it wasn't as nice as the intercontinental. It was so stark in it's gardens. The outside was plain, MUCH smaller beach than ours. By far the intercontinental was much nicer. Always security around but you didn't notice them. I would go back in a heatbeat. I have been to MANY islands and this is on the top of my list. Much to see and do there. Great pool, restaurants. You MUST make this a place to visit.","ratings":{"Overall":5.0},"author":"Rosalyn Becker","date":"2015-03-26 08:13:20 +0300"},{"content":"Hotel is very nice, must visit old san juan, ruth's chris is expensive but worth every penny, beach had too many people selling things - got sick of saying \"not interested\" Taxi rides will blow your mind! Beach had a lot of washed up weed and wasn't as nice as Cancun. I never paid for towels, beach use or chair use??? We booked hotel and airfare for 350 a person for 3 nights from Maine on site59, great deal for the money, would go back for under 500 a person air/hotel. Food directly across the street is good and inexpensive, breakfast for 3-4 dollars, lunch 5-6 bucks. Hotel breakfast is 18+ each.","ratings":{"Overall":4.0},"author":"Jordan Kessler","date":"2015-07-30 09:14:38 +0300"},{"content":"My wife and I just returned from a weekâ€™s stay. The room was nice and the staff was very friendly. The staff highlight were the concierge's. They were the reason our stay was extra special. A week before arrival they made arrangements for several tours. Our second night in San Juan was my wife's birthday and they suggested Aguaviva and took care of the details for us, the restaurant was excellent. They assisted several times with directions and getting our boarding passes when the hotel's internet service was down. Five starts for concierge's. Dinner at the restaurant was very good and priced competitively. The hotel is close to everything in Old San Juan. We only had two minor issues, one was internet service, it was not available for most of the stay and had to have our boarding passes faxed to the hotel after using a cell phone to check in, which to say the least was painful. The second was breakfast. The buffet offered did not live up to the $20.00 per person. Our breakfast there was $50.00 with the tip and tax while a short walk to local eateries was one-fifth the price and just as good.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Marcia Schumm","date":"2015-12-05 01:25:13 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed for 8 nights. Four for a meeting and four to enjoy San Juan. The room was a suite and great. Room service was available for breakfast and dinner. The food was well prepared and the room service staff was very good. Security was good in that all guests needed to use their room cards for elevator access to room floors. The casino clientel was a little trashy. I did not enjoy using the casino. Viewing the cruise ships from the 9th floor pool area was great. Especially as they came in or departed. At ground level the ships are closer than anywhere else I've been. Great photo ops. Two blocks behind the hotel is a restaurant street with lots of local fair with entertainment. Many have outside dining and the atmosphere was great. All of Old San Juan is walkable from this hotel. Note: There is a CVS just down the street to buy beer, wine, sodas, water, and snacks. You will save significant amounts. Other people have complained about the mold. The stairs area near the pool was bad. Our room on the 8th floor was fine. The elevator area on the room floors had minor mold. The meeting areas were fine. The wi-fi was spotty. Good at times, connection issues at other times. Overall-marginal. The price was high but expected based on the location.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Ryley Koelpin","date":"2013-11-07 09:20:36 +0300"},{"content":"Just back from a lovely time in old San Juan. We got a good price at the Sheraton on Priceline. I was a little unsure of the location due to the proximity to the cruise ships. and the possibility of being overrun by passengers every time we stepped out the door. It never was a problem. In fact I enjoyed looking out and seeing which ship was in every day. I found the location so central to all of old San Juan that I'd choose it again for just that reason. Every staff person we came in contact with was friendly and helpful. We had a standard room, and it was fine. It isn't shiny new, and the furniture was dark old wood of the West Indies style. I liked it all. The beds were very comfy and house keeping did a good job of cleaning and fulfilling any requests we had. In the room, I never heard other guests except the ones in the halls who appeared to be returning from late night partying. It feels like on weekends all of the island comes to town, so there is probably noise everywhere. My suggestion would be to join them and walk around the old town as late as you want. Around the hotel feels very safe, as does all the town within the confines of the tourist areas. The gym was adequate. It was nice to look out over the sea from the treadmills. The pool is small, as others have reported. Not having gone on vacation to swim, I didn't mind. I felt I could have done some laps had I been inclined to -just short ones.The few times we went up to sit by the pool there were chairs open, and it was peaceful. I imagine if a large family came in it would feel a bit crowded. I do like a bit of slot playing, but it didn't take more than one night to find I wasn't going to be lucky in the casino. It's small, and has less choices than I'm accustomed to. Maybe give it an evening if you like. The locals go there and are fun to chat with. I learned from them that while playing the machines, you can order not only free drinks, but free sandwiches as well. They were having some sort of ham and cheese cooked things that might make a nice snack for the price of a tip. If you aren't driving, skip this part...We rented a car to get out and see more of the island. To avoid the $21.40/nt valet parking, we parked on the street. Coming back in the day time, there was usually a spot within a block of the hotel. You have to look closely, because it's illegal to park where the curb has yellow or blue paint. You will see many people park there anyway, and I don't know how many tickets were written. At night, there are various fellows who stand on the curbs and direct people into parking spaces. They will guide you in as if they are teaching you to parallel park for the first time, then they stand near waiting for a dollar or two tip. We questioned one man after we parked and realized the curb was yellow. He assured us the police didn't give tickets at night for parking there. We moved the car shortly anyway, and soon saw a ticket being written to someone else nearby, so - do it at your own risk. On the weekend, the city seems to fill up and make street parking at less available. We ended up valet parking Friday and Saturday night. There are 2 or 3 parking garages near the hotel. Short term, they seem like a decent price, but it's unclear about the pricing for 24 hr parking.Check before you enter and have to pay to leave if you change your mind. We didn't find a garage that was less than the valet for our needs. We did do some driving in and around town. I wouldn't have had the patience for it had i been on my own, but my friend drives regularly in London and found it manageable. If you can't decide about getting a car, you can walk all over old town and just rent when you want to get out of town. The major touristy sites out of SJ also have tours to take you if you don't want to drive.There's a Hertz office in the Sheraton. We took a taxi to Coronado one evening so we could drink, and it was $12 one way and $15 back. Taxi to airport from the hotel was $21. If you are going to the Sheraton pre-cruise, do your research and see where your ship docks. You may be able to just cross the street and board, but if it's farther down the docks, you may choose a short taxi ride. As for the restaurants in the hotel, there were so many others we wanted to try, we didn't eat there except for a quick burger. It was just that - a burger. Nothing more. I recommend getting up and walking the city early while it's cool, or near sunset. There is so much to see and if you get lost, just head downhill toward the docks and you'll find the Sheraton. No matter where you choose to stay, do get out and soak in the charm and color of old San Juan.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Lavonne Jakubowski","date":"2015-09-16 01:32:34 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Lexus Mante","Golda Anderson"],"vacancy":true,"description":"3 Star Hotel next to the Mountain Railway terminus and set in 30 acres of grounds which include Dolbadarn Castle","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
