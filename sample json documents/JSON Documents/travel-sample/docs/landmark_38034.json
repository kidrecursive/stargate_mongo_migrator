The best time to visit is during low tide when rocks are exposed and visitors can expect to find everything from starfish to the occasional octopus.  Seals are usually present on the beach as well.  Parking is limited and can be tough to find on weekends.  Docent tours are available.","geo":{"lat":37.52322,"lon":-122.51724,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":38034,"country":"United States","city":"Moss Beach","state":"California","image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Sea_grapes%2C_Fitzgerald_Marine_Reserve.jpg"}
