( I am not easy to please)2) Staff was friendly, especially front desk Jill, as I checked out earlier than anticipated, w/o a problem a) Room cleaning staff didn't understand english, and gave glaring stares...which I didn't pay attention to, after all this is BECKS.3) The metal gates have curbed the outside cruising, but if you're lucky, they will have hot guest in the rooms on your stay... a)solution: walk down Market and find what you need, and bring them to the room...that's all.4)Internet service(wifi) was awesome, stayed connected 24/7 with few interuptions..4) Easy walk to Castro. 5) Free parking, awesome.(limited though)++this is not a Five Star or Three Diamond property, but a convenient, clean, safe place to stay. It was my first time alone, w/o my partner, and the room served it's purpose.Much to my surprise, all my cruising was done away from BECKS, and it was a great, satisfying trip. **All in all, I would stay again, and again at Becks....as I feel they are still concerned w/pleasing the community.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Business service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Alayna Stokes","date":"2014-11-05 21:28:48 +0300"},{"content":"Bad Service, Noisy I initially booked three nights (my wife and I) and decided to leave after the fist one for a nice gay operated BB a few blocks away for cheaper!
