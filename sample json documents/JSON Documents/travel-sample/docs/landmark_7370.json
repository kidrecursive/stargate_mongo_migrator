Salt Creek is about two miles west of the main road via an easy dirt road.  This place is great.  Long ago Death Valley was a lake with fish in it; as the lake dried up and salinity increased the fish evolved to cope.  Now they are restricted to a short, salty creek which springs up out of the desert, flows for a few hundred yards, and then disappears back into the sand.","geo":{"lat":36.59076,"lon":-116.99012,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":7370,"country":"United States","city":"Inyo County","state":"California"}
