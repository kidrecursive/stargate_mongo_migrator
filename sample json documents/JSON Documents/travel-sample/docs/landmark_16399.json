{"title":"London/South Kensington-Chelsea","name":"King's Road","alt":null,"address":null,"directions":"tube: Sloane Square, for north-east end","phone":null,"tollfree":null,"email":null,"url":null,"hours":null,"image":null,"price":null,"content":"One of London's smartest fashion streets, having evolved from the cutting-edge of bohemia and innovative fashion in the 60s to a more genteel place to indulge in retail therapy, albeit with a notable presence of trendy young Londoners (including many so called Sloane Rangers). It is a very attractive street that retains the atmosphere of a small town whilst being in the heart of a huge city. There is a huge range of fashion stores from upmarket chains to one-off boutiques, as well as variety of other shops, complimented by caf√©s, restaurants, bars, pubs and clubs. There is an obvious affluence to the road without any bling or snobbiness. King's Road stretches south-west from here for miles, though the best of the shopping is in the first mile.","geo":{"lat":51.487,"lon":-0.169,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"buy","type":"landmark","id":16399,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null}
