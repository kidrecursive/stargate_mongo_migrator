It is the only mission in the [[East Bay]] region, and its land grant once encompassed most of the East Bay. The original 1809 adobe church (which served as a saloon and general store during secularization) was destroyed by an 1868 earthquake along the Hayward fault. The current mission building underwent a four-year reconstruction project to produce a modern replica of the 1809 adobe church with 4-5ft steel-reinforced walls and was dedicated in 1985 for daily Mass and tours. The only surviving building from the Spanish period is a monastery, which serves as a small museum of seven rooms that houses a collection of artifacts, vestments, and memorabilia. The small cemetery holds the graves of many prominent Spanish and American settlers, whose prominence allowed the gilding of the mission's altar.","geo":{"lat":37.533399,"lon":-121.919684,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":37521,"country":"United States","city":"Fremont","state":"California"}
