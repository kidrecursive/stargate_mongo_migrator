Well, how about dining on a floating island?  Forbes Island is a floating wooden island (100 foot by 50 foot) complete with a lighthouse, waterfall, and real palm trees.  It was built in 1975 and was originally intended to be a floating home... the creator was inspired by the novel ''&quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.&quot;''  The dining room is partially under water and portholes give you an underwater view from your table. It's moored about 100 yards from the sea lions at Pier 39 and a pontoon ride will have to take you there and back... so don't drink too much!  The cuisine is French.","geo":{"lat":37.8106,"lon":-122.4124,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":25653,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
