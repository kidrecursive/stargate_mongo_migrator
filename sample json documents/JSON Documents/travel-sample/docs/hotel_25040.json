It is a former SRO that was once occupied by crack addicts and the homeless that has had new beds and flat screen televisions put into it. The hallways are narrow and shabby. The elevators are slow. The lobby is kitsch. My room is literally the size of a prison cell. The window is not much larger than what you would find in a prison. The closet is so small they can't even have a door for it. It is little more than a curtain. The room is so small I wish they had not put the tiny bathroom in it. I don't mind shared bathrooms if it means you don't feel like you're in jail. There is simply no reason what so ever to stay at this hotel. For an extra $10-$20 a night you can stay in far superior hotels.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":1.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":1.0},"author":"Trace Schneider","date":"2014-02-12 23:24:02 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Jovanny Rohan","Dorothea Oberbrunner I","Velma Weissnat","Miss Jamel Little","Josiane Marks","Sally Kozey","Lesly Donnelly","Daniela Rosenbaum PhD"],"vacancy":false,"description":"[[Novelty architecture|Novelty]] motel established 1949 with each room as a free-standing concrete wigwam.
