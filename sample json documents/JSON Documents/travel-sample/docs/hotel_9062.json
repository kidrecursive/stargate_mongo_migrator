Nice front desk staff and nice area for exploring. Lots to do around the hotel. The room was dark and forlorn but that was okay, the bed was good and it had a fridge and micro, i think. Great area, Old Town San Diego is awesome. Crazee Burger is stellar, so is Coyote Grill. Too much good food and drink makes for a good trip. Beaches are a short drive. Downtown Gaslamp is epic.","ratings":{"Location":5.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":4.0,"Rooms":3.0},"author":"Weldon Schiller","date":"2013-07-25 03:09:31 +0300"}],"public_likes":[],"vacancy":false,"description":"5 mins walk to Friog Beach, a B&B that can accommodate up to 12 people.
