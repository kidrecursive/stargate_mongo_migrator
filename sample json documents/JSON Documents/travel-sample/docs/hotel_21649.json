I read some of the reviews and they were fairly positive so I was surprised at how disappointed I was. First, the hotel is old and it looks and smells moldy; they are renovating so maybe they will take care of the smell. The receptionists at check-in were unpleasant at best. They did not make eye contact and acted like we were a nuisance. We were not told about any features of the hotel - the pool, the restaurant, the bar, amenities, etc. Our room was okay. It had a kitchenette, which was nice, but the fridge leaked so whatever you put in there got filled with water within hours. The freezer was so full of ice it could not be used. There was a microwave, sink and shelving. The room was a decent size and looked fairly clean but the bathroom had mold on the walls and the tile in the shower was literally crumbling. The water coming out of the shower was hot and came out fast - a big plus, but we did not have a tub stopper so we had a heck of a time giving our baby a bath. On a least two occasions, housekeeping did not leave us fresh towels or coffee and when we called the front desk to ask for some they told us they only had one working dryer and we would have to wait until the towels were washed. The patio was small but it faced the ocean which was nice. What wasn't nice were the other tenants that were smoking all around us which made sitting on the patio (and by the pool) unpleasant. The hotel is within walking distance of the boardwalk and ocean shops. The pool was clean but the shallow, three-foot area for kids was very small which made it difficult for my six-year-old to play. There was a one-foot baby pool that was filled with stagnant water - gross. The restaurant on site, Atlantic Jacks, was terrible. We had Groupons to use so we decided to have dinner there the first night. We were the only people there (which should have clued us in that this was not a good place to eat). We ordered and never got our food. We waited 20 minutes, I asked the server where our food was and she laughed. My daughter got bored and crawled under the table and announced that there was gum under the table. We got up and left. We decided to use our Groupons at the bar instead - they didn't have wine and the bartender didn't have what he needed to make most of the drinks they advertised on their sign. He got irritated when I asked him to put cherries in my daughter's Shirley Temple. The bar is connected to the restaurant so if you eat in the restaurant, be prepared to smell smoke. We found out on our sixth day there that they had a breakfast buffet. We spent $30 for, basically, a continental breakfast - cold bacon, cold sausage, toast, danishes covered in fruit flies from the bar, fruit, hard biscuits and hard, cold waffles. The elevators, stairs and parking are a MAJOR safety concern and I will be writing a letter to their corporate office about my observations. The stairwells run on the outside of the hotel and the doors leading to the stairs and to the rooms are unlocked so anyone with ill intentions can hide there. As a woman, I didn't feel safe using the stairs. Plus, they reeked of urine. Secondly, the elevators are very dangerous. The doors close very quickly and the safety feature that lets you wave a hand in front of the door to keep it from closing was not working so my family and I almost had arms and legs crushed by the door, literally. With two kids, bikes, a stroller, a beach tent, etc., it took a minute to get off the elevator and one time the door closed on my arm as I was holding my daughter's hand. She was still in the elevator and I had to put my body in the door of the elevator and push it open. My daughter was screaming and I was completely panicked. The same thing happened to my husband. The other safety concern I had was that we had to park across the street in the overflow lot. I did not feel safe walking there by myself. My husband had to make numerous trips there and he was often stopped by homeless people asking for money. And, it was across the street from Lollipops Gentlemen's Club. Not something I want my six-year-old to see. On our last night there, someone set fire to the dumpster that was right below our room. It could have easily caught the hotel on fire. No one was alerted, the smoke alarms did not go off but the next day, the entire dumpster and surrounding wooden shed it was encased in was burnt to a crisp. Other observations - The pool did not have a bar and the bar did not open until 5; no one was monitoring the pool so there were a few times where unruly kids were carrying on and being obnoxious; we got hassled by some guy as we were entering the building one night (not sure if he was staying there or if he was homeless); dogs are allowed so you may be kept awake by barking; elevators are slow (there are only two); the beach in front of the hotel was great - clean and quiet; the air conditioner fan ran all night which was great for us; the beds and pillows are very firm. We will not be staying at this hotel again or recommending it to others.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":2.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Miss Katarina McKenzie","date":"2012-05-17 05:56:16 +0300"},{"content":"We have stayed at many hotels in the area and none can compare to this one. The hotel is very clean, from the lobby to the rooms. It has a fresh feel and nice clean scent that many other hotels in the area struggle with. We found the amenities to be more than expected with a larger than normal room, a fridge, a microwave and a coffee pot. There was also a cute little restaurant and bar with access to the pool for the days that we decide to relax by the beach. The staff was incredibly friendly and extremely helpful! It's located right on the beach and its only a short walk to mall/movie theaters. I would recommend this hotel above all others that I have stayed at in Daytona.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Miss Bria Bruen","date":"2012-02-13 23:47:04 +0300"},{"content":"Even though I had read the reviews, I was disappointed with the wear of the hotel. It started with the dated and worn decor in the lobby / elevator and continued to the room. We stayed in room 720. The bathroom sink was cracked, the tub leaked, the toliet would continue to run, all the fixtures were rusty, there was unpainted dry wall repair, the decor was worn and mismatched. My husband was perfectly happy with the room but I would have preferred a more up to date room. The ice machine on our floor did not work. The staff was friendly enough but didn't interact with them much during our 5 day stay The room was clean, the view was great, parking was good but is an additional cost. The restaurant was okay, the only reason we patronized it was because we had coupons for it. The location was perfect. The pool area was clean and well maintained. I would only stay here again if I couldn't get a decent rate else where.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Murl Stamm V","date":"2013-07-23 17:36:07 +0300"},{"content":"We got to this hotel 2 days before official Business Trip to Hilton / Waldorf Astoria in Orlando, FL.

All the employees were so friendly and helpful and made us feel our enjoyable experience was very important to them. We stayed in one of their beach-front suites (thank you Mo) which we were able to reserve at an exceptional price just hours before our arrival. Their restaurant is very nice and the free breakfast was wonderful. The bar is very quaint and friendly. Beach front access was of utmost importance to us and we got it. Although the hotel itself could use some updating and painting in some areas (the main one the balcony) it was nothing obvious and did not affect our stay. Highly recommend this hotel.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Mr. Alexandrea Heathcote","date":"2014-04-19 07:44:03 +0300"},{"content":"Upon check in we were given a room without a kitchenette but that was no big problem. The staff at the front desk were quick to fix the problem. However my idea of a kitchenette and theirs are two different things. Other than a microwave there was no way to cook anything and there was no kitchen table. Which meant we were going to have to spend more than expected on eating out. Although the view was beautiful, the rooms were clean and they were tended to daily. The worst thing about this hotel was the elavator wait times. And don't plan on taking the stairs, they smell like pee. If you weren't in the rooms the rest of the hotel felt muggy. The main area and the restaurant were okay though. The pool was a little over crowded but it was to be expected. Oh and the main lobby during busy pool hours was wet due to all the traffic. The hotel was close to everything which made it an ideal pick, I do think next time I will spend the extra $60-$70 and stay and the Plaza Resort and Spa next door. Atleast they had 3 elavators.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Keven Johnston","date":"2013-11-21 05:24:32 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Nikki Kuvalis","Quentin Zboncak","Lavonne Sipes III"],"vacancy":true,"description":"No membership card required.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
