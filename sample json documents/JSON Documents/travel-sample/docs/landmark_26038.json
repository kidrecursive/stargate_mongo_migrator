Recently cleaned up, this park is still under used. With rolling hills and views galore, this is the best place in the city to get away from it. If you have a dog, bring it to the reservoir on Shelley Drive where there is a large off-leash area where your pet can romp in the fields or swim in the water. There is an amphitheater, a duck pond, multiple playgrounds, some great hiking trails, and a few tennis courts.","geo":{"lat":37.7185,"lon":-122.4193,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":26038,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
