Unlike some of the local eateries in the &quot;tandoor-loin,&quot; the seating is clean, comfortable, and fairly new (possibly the results of some other restaurant's going-out-of-business sale). The restaurant tends to be comparatively quiet, as well as offering an excellent view of police actions on Jones St.","geo":{"lat":37.7856,"lon":-122.4131,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":25550,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
