She's a spitfire and a complete rock star. She'll end up doing shots with you, sneaking shots into your drinks, force-feeding you endless peanuts and making adorable and incessant conversation. The crowd's an eclectic mix, which makes for great people-watching, especially when the karaoke is broken out.","geo":{"lat":37.7975,"lon":-122.4071,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":25473,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
