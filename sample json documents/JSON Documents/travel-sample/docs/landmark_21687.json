It eventually housed Louis XIV until the move to [[Versailles]]. It includes also a beautiful garden ''Les jardins du Palais Royal'', enclosed by the buildings. It's been the theatre of one of the seminal events of the French Revolution (Camille Desmoulins made a famous declaration here in 1789). The ''Théatre Français'' nearby was built in 1716. There are numerous restaurants inside the garden , including famous ''Le Grand Véfour''. There's also the controversial ''Colonnes de Buren'', striped columns installed within the inside yard amid the 17th century architecture.","geo":{"lat":48.86358,"lon":2.33702,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":21687,"country":"France","city":"Paris-1ER-Arrondissement","state":"Île-de-France","image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Palais_Royal_wts.jpg"}
