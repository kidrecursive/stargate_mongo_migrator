Unfortunately, due to strong currents, the beach is not very safe for swimming, but for &quot;land-lovers&quot; it does have many outdoor barbeques and designated picnic areas to eat and relax at. Toward the northern end of the beach there is also an unofficial nude section that mainly seems to attract gay men. It has free parking and clean restrooms.","geo":{"lat":37.7922,"lon":-122.4845,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25719,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
