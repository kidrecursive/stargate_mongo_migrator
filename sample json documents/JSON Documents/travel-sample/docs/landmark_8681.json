(Be aware that it's actually illegal to mention Morningside without describing it as ''douce'' - just search online for news items mentioning the area for evidence of this). Heinous crimes such as &quot;owning a rucsac&quot;, &quot;using a mobile phone&quot; and &quot;waving a camera about&quot;, among others, are liable to result in instant dismissal and a lifetime ban. Don't let the grumpy reputation put you off however as this is a comfortably civilised place to spend some time, with an excellent range of ales, impressive wine list, and a whisky menu as long as your arm. Good food too.","geo":{"lat":55.9276,"lon":-3.20914,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":8681,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Edinburgh","state":null}
