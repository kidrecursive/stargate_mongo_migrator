You can find their wines in your local grocery store or in a cafe in Budapest. Big Zinfandel is the winner here, and you can try their exclusive collections of small-lot wines. Try the Barricia Zinfandel; it's tasty and goes down easy on a chilly Sonoma evening. Be sure to pick up their Zin flavored Sriracha sauce, it's made onsite and exclusive to the winery.","geo":{"lat":38.30085,"lon":-122.441539,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":27778,"country":"United States","city":"Sonoma","state":"California"}
