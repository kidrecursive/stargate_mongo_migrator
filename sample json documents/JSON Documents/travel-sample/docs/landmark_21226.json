It dominates the city and also the Rhone and Comtadine countryside as far as  mont Ventoux, providing a breathtaking panorama. Remnants of the history of the city, particularly those of the castle of the Princes of Nassau, can be seen in this park. The castle was one of the most beautiful fortresses in Europe, fortified by Maurice of Nassau in 1622. It was destroyed on the orders of Louis XIV in 1673. On 29 July 1952, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands planted an oak tree on the hill.","geo":{"lat":44.13284207830619,"lon":4.808042049407959,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":21226,"country":"France","city":"Orange","state":"Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d'Azur","image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Colline-Saint-Eutrope-Est.jpg"}
