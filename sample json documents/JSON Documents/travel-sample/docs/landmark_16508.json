The pub has a seedy past—it was infamous as a hangout for gang bosses and crime lords in the 1950s and 60s, and the Great Train Robbery was planned here, and celebrities of the era would come to socialise with the criminals. Today it is a safer, friendlier and more comfortable establishment that has recently been refurbished.","geo":{"lat":51.4984,"lon":-0.1559,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":16508,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/The_Star_Tavern_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1296504.jpg"}
