Built by Gustave Eiffel in 1887-1889, the tower was almost torn down in 1909 and only saved due to its use as a telegraphy antenna. Note that the queues can be very long. The tower has recently begun allowing online reservations at its website, allowing visitors the choice of a date and time frame. Bear in mind that if you miss the time on your ticket, it's useless. The north, west, and east pillars have elevators that go to the first and second floors; the south pillar has stairs that can be climbed to the second floor. To reach the top floor, an additional elevator ride is required, and the wait for this can be very long as well. Unfortunately, disabled visitors are not allowed beyond the second floor due to safety concerns. Taking the Métro as far as Ecole Militiare and then strolling up the Champ de Mars is a lovely way to arrive at the tower. Another phenomenal approach is to exit the Metro at Trocadero and see the Eiffel Tower from the other side of the Ecole Militaire.","geo":{"lat":48.85804,"lon":2.2945,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":21799,"country":"France","city":"Paris","state":"Île-de-France","image_direct_url":""}
