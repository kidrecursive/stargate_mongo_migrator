The waiters, which change often, are not very attentive and almost yank the plates and glasses from the customer as soon as they have finished. The restaurant can be very busy due to its location, but the service leaves a lot to be desired.","geo":{"lat":51.4943,"lon":-0.1742,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":16414,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null}
