It is one of Englandâ€™s finest and most complete Jacobean houses, filled not only with a mixture of rare and everyday objects, furniture and textiles collected since its completion in 1612, but also with the atmosphere of 400 years of continuous occupation by one family. The gardens have a typical Elizabethan and Jacobean layout with a ring of fascinating topiary at their heart and it was here in 1865 that the rules of modern croquet were codified. Since acquiring the property, the Trust has concentrated on conserving it rather than restoring it to a pristine state.","geo":{"lat":51.960098,"lon":-1.63895,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":6936,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Oxfordshire","state":null}
