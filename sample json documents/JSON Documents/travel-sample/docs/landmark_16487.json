As this changing of the guard is less famous than the Buckingham Palace affair, the crowds are usually smaller; plus there are no railings here to spoil the view.  The ceremony does not take place in very wet weather.  The cavalry are based at Hyde Park Barracks and can be seen proceeding through the park, under the Wellington Arch, along Constitution Hill and The Mall each morning.","geo":{"lat":51.5047,"lon":-0.1275,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":16487,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null}
