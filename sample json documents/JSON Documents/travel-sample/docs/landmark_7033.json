Their chocolate contains no dairy, so the end result is a dark chocolate that is very different from what most people are used to. Bars are sold at $6 each that include different amounts of cacao and flavorings such as sea salt or almond. A &quot;tasting&quot; option is also available in the store, as well as flavored chocolate drinks.","geo":{"lat":33.99694,"lon":-118.43047,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"buy","type":"landmark","id":7033,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
