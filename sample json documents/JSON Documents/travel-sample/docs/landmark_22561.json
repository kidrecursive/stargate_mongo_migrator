{"title":"Plymouth (England)","name":"Tinside Lido","alt":null,"address":null,"directions":null,"phone":null,"tollfree":null,"email":null,"url":null,"hours":null,"image":null,"price":null,"content":"An outdoor swimming pool on the shorefront, just below the Hoe. It was constructed in the 1930s to an elegant Art Deco design and has also been featured on the BBC's ''Coast'' series. The lido is open during the summer (June, July and August, perhaps the first week or two of September) and is a fun place to swim, play in the water, or sunbathe. There are fun sessions with inflatables and a fountain - amazing on a sunny day. For a long time it was derelict and abandoned, but after demand from citizens it was renovated and reopened a few years ago. You also get a fantastic view of the sound. Recently featured on a Royal Mail stamp collection. Admission charge applies.","geo":{"lat":50.3631,"lon":-4.1424,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":22561,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Plymouth","state":null}
