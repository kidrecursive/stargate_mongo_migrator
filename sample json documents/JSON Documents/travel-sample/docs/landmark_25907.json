Decent reasonably priced drinks. Open and drafty; on (frequent) cold evenings you'll be drinking with your coat on. Closest good dive to the awesome El Farolito taqueria at 24th and Mission: getting Farolito's massive nachos to go to eat at the Attic over cocktails is recommended.","geo":{"lat":37.7523,"lon":-122.4192,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":25907,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
