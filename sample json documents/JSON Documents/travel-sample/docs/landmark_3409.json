With a bar perfectly situated upon entering, there is a nice emphasis on cocktail culture to go along with the juicy steaks, fish and seafood and other classic dishes. The d√©cor is decidedly masculine, with an east coast (think Manhattan) tenor permeating the usually noisy room. A phenomenal menu top to bottom.","geo":{"lat":34.067416,"lon":-118.401952,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":3409,"country":"United States","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"California"}
