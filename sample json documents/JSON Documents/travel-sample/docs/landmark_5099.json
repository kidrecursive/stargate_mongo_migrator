Established in 1771, it is considered to be one of the most beautiful of the missions. Father Serra, the leader behind the greater Spanish mission to California, is buried along with his most faithful lieutenant at the front of the church.  During the lifetimes of Father Serra and Father Fermin Lasuen, it was the headquarters of the mission system from 1771 until 1833. Self-guided tours take you through the remaining original buildings which now hold exhibits, a small museum, and a gift shop. Catholic Masses occur regularly. Keep in mind that the mission is a working Catholic church, so dress and act respectfully.","geo":{"lat":36.542622,"lon":-121.918943,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":5099,"country":"United States","city":"Carmel-by-the-Sea","state":"California"}
