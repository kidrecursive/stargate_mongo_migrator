The museum is not run by the Walt Disney Company, meaning that while it views Walt Disney in a favorable light, it doesn't come off as corporate propaganda.  The collections have some fascinating Disneyana, including the Oscar awarded to Disney for Snow White, a multiplane camera used prominently in Disney animated films, and a number of posters promoting early Disneyland rides.  This is an absolute must-see for Disney enthusiasts, but even casual Disney fans will be impressed by the material here, which does a very good job of showing how a man with a gift for cartooning built what would become a modern media empire.","geo":{"lat":37.8014,"lon":-122.4587,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25701,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
