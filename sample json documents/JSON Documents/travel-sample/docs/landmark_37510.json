The tenth California Mission to be constructed, it was consecrated in 1786 as the first of Father Lasuen's nine missions. Today, Mission Santa Barbara is both a scenic wonder and a fine anthropological study of original native culture in the surrounding area. Santa Barbara is the only California mission with twin bell towers, owing to its status as a cathedral in the early days of California statehood. It also has had a longer continuous association with the Franciscans than any other mission, and a longer continuous history of choral music than any other mission. The headquarters of the mission system in the 1830s and 40s, it is where many of the archives concerning the California missions are held. The presence of the mission inspired the city of Santa Barbara to build its buildings primarily in the Mission Revival style. Well worth a visit, note the adjacent pottery kiln and tanning vat ruins.","geo":{"lat":34.438333,"lon":-119.713917,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":37510,"country":"United States","city":"Santa Barbara","state":"California"}
