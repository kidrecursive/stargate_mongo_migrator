It was founded by Charles II in 1675 and is, by international decree, the official starting point for each new day, year and millennium (at the stroke of midnight GMT as measured from the Prime Meridian). Now a detached part of the National Maritime Museum, it houses an impressive display and a recently-built planetarium. There are several different star shows per day and are well worth the money, especially as it's now the only celestial performance of its kind around, after the London Planterium completly converted to Maddam Taussads.","geo":{"lat":51.4778,"lon":-0.0015,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16121,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Royal_observatory_greenwich.jpg"}
