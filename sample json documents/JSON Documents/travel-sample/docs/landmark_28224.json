St Salvator's Chapel is used for University services every Sunday, and visitors will see staff and students in the traditional university dress (red gowns for undergraduate students of the United College). After chapel, students walk down to the end of the pier in the traditional ''Pier Walk''. On North Street, just outside St Salvator's Quad, visitors will see the letters ''PH'' in the cobbles. This is the site where the martyr Patrick Hamilton was burned at the stake, and it is considered bad luck to walk on the letters: it is said that students who walk across these letters will fail their degree but can remove the 'curse' by bathing in the sea at dawn on 1st May (The May Dip).","geo":{"lat":56.3417,"lon":-2.79421,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":28224,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Saint Andrews","state":null}
