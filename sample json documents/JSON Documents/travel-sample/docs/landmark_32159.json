This Northern Italian seafood restaurant features an indoor seating area and a patio, with menu items available in either &quot;individual&quot; or &quot;gargantuan&quot; portions (for family-style meals). The wait staff is friendly, and every night during dinner hours, activity temporarily pauses for a restaurant-wide singalong of Dean Martin's &quot;That's Amore,&quot; during which servers roam around and toast with the diners. The atmosphere is comfortable and fun, and their garlic balls are famous. Prices range from $5-10 for &quot;individual&quot; sized dinner antipasti to $15-20 for &quot;gargantuan&quot; sized entrees.","geo":{"lat":33.97938,"lon":-118.46624,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":32159,"country":"United States","city":"Marina del Rey","state":"California"}
