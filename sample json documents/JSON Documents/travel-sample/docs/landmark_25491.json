This being San Francisco, the crowd tends to show up on the late side, but when they turn out they arrive in force. Fuse isn't that big, so if you arrive after everyone, be prepared to wait in line. The dance floor is minimal, establishing a space that's more for drinking and enjoying the music than getting funky. However, the quality of music is fun, and the bar staff is very friendly.","geo":{"lat":37.7982,"lon":-122.4053,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":25491,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
