The French-inspired menu is quite pricey, and the restaurant is a favorite among the city's movers and shakers. It is located in the gorgeous El Paseo building, one of the city's earliest Spanish Colonial Revival structures. If you're looking for a cheaper taste of the menu and a more casual atmosphere, try Intermezzo Bar + Café, the bar area off to the side. They offer delicious, fresh-baked flatbreads.","geo":{"lat":34.421074,"lon":-119.698902,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":26401,"country":"United States","city":"Santa Barbara","state":"California"}
