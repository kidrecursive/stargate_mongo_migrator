Most of the buildings here are embassies or ambassadorial residences but the rest of the mansions belong to some of the richest people in the country (or elsewhere).  For added historical value, during World War II, the current Norwegian embassy was where King Haakon VII led the Norwegian government-in-exile (commemorated by a blue plaque) and MI19's &quot;London Cage&quot; prisoner-of-war facility was located here.  There is no public right of way but the Crown Estate allow pedestrians and cyclists to use the street; photography is not permitted.","geo":{"lat":51.506,"lon":-0.1907,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16374,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Entrance_to_Kensington_Palace_Gardens_-_geograph.org.uk_-_237797.jpg"}
