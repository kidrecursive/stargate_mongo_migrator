The building also houses a National Trust shop and the Winchester Youth Hostel (see 'Sleep'). Opening hours are very complex, but the mill is open Mar-Oct Sa-Su 11AM-4PM and much more often in summer; visit the web site or phone the number above for more details.","geo":{"lat":51.062,"lon":-1.30771,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":33422,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Winchester","state":null}
