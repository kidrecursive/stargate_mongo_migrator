The rest of the year, the guard changes on alternate days, weather permitting. A board is placed outside the palace in the morning to say whether the Changing of the Guard ceremony will take place or not. There is no charge to view the Changing of the Guardâ€”simply turn up and stand at the fence in front of the Palace, but it is worth getting there early to ensure a good view, particularly when the weather is fine.","geo":{"lat":51.50159,"lon":-0.14116,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":16486,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null}
