This tower looks over the Oban bay. It takes about 15 minutes to walk up the hill by one of several signposted routes on roads, or by steps. There are good views of Kerrera and Mull and looking up the Sound of Mull. On Tuesdays and Thursdays each week during the summer the Oban Pipe Band play at the tower for about an hour from 8pm until 9pm. Admission is by donation. There are a few benches but if you want one of these get there early. If you are highly sensitive to insect bites then bring some miggie repellant to fend of Scotland's national pest.","geo":{"lat":56.4157,"lon":-5.4692,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":20944,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Oban","state":null}
