Of the most famous London sights, St Paul's is the one most conveniently located for the Barbican. It's a significant building in British history, having been the site of the funerals of several British military leaders (Nelson, Wellington, Churchill), and significantly held peace services marking the end of the two world wars. The cathedral is also famous for its ''Whispering Wall'', as well as its stunning view over the city. The crypt is also open to the public, holding the tombs of Nelson, Wellington and Christopher Wren. It is possible to sidestep the admission charge by entering for one of the midday services, even if you don't take part; however you'd still need a ticket to get to the top.
