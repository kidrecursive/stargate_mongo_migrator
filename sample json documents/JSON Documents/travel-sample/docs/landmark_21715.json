In August 1944 Hemingway made a booze-powered drive into Paris ''ahead'' of the advancing Free French 2nd Tank Division to &quot;liberate the Ritz&quot;, and specifically the bar which was shortly thereafter renamed in his honour. Today the bar is considered by many to be one of the best bars in the world, in no small part due to the bar-tending skills of Colin Field, who creates elaborate cocktails as a fine art, and with the rest of the staff is skilled at bringing his guests together in conversation.","geo":{"lat":48.869013,"lon":2.3276673,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":21715,"country":"France","city":"Paris-1ER-Arrondissement","state":"Île-de-France"}
