Excellent jukebox, though after 9PM they tend to turn it up just a touch too loud. Frequently has great DJ's playing funk / R&B but varies; clientele leans toward the gentrification crowd. Lots of smoke from the VIP room in the back filters out into the main bar. Excellent happy hour!","geo":{"lat":37.7647,"lon":-122.4224,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":25911,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
