Just east lies the site of the original Spanish presidio, built in 1776 on this windswept slope. A boulder by the sidewalk approximates the northwest corner of the original Presidio, which formed a square about 300 feet (100 m) on each side. Two bronze cannons at this site, forged in the 1600s, were originally mounted at Castillo de San Joaquin, a fort built at the point overlooking the Golden Gate. They are among the oldest cannon in North America.","geo":{"lat":37.7984,"lon":-122.4589,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25710,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
