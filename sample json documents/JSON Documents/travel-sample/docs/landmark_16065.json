Something of a &quot;hidden gem&quot;, this small, independent museum is dedicated to him—and, with its historic interiors, paintings and prints, personal effects and other exhibits—gives an impression of what it might have been like during his occupancy from 1748-1759. Built in 1700, this impressive period building—a rare example of its kind in the area—survived the brutal onslaught of the Blitz during World War II and is now maintained in excellent condition.","geo":{"lat":51.51489,"lon":-0.10837,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16065,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null}
