During lunch, it gets busy with stay at home mom's and kids, but in the evening it's a hip date and social spot. A bar serves only small plates, but the restaurant serves sit down dinner. An ever changing menu based on seasonal ingredients, craft cocktails and wine. Outdoor patio is right on College Avenue, and a great place for people watching.","geo":{"lat":37.84722,"lon":-122.25195,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":20893,"country":"United States","city":"Oakland","state":"California"}
