There are also many other pretty Victorians encircling the lovely park. The 21-Hayes bus route goes along its south side, the 5-Fulton bus passes by a block north of the park, or if you enjoy walking and don't mind modest grades you can get there by walking west from Hayes Valley or north from the [[San Francisco/Haight|Haight]].","geo":{"lat":37.77661,"lon":-122.43468,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":26239,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California","image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/View_from_Alamo_Square%2C_San_Francisco-2.jpg"}
