The park spans the Sacramento River, whose two sides are linked by one of Redding's most iconic landmarks: the '''Sundial Bridge''', a 700-foot pedestrian footbridge designed by architect and engineer Santiago Calatrava.  The '''Turtle Bay Museum''' features different hands-on exhibits relating to the history of the Redding area, and two exhibits which change monthly.  The '''Monolith''', near the southern end of the park, is Redding's last surviving remnant of when Redding was used as a gravel processing and transport hub for the construction of Shasta Dam.","geo":{"lat":40.591523,"lon":-122.377043,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":23635,"country":"United States","city":"Redding","state":"California"}
