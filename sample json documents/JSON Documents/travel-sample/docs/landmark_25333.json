Diablo to the east, downtown San Francisco, the Bay Bridge, Twin Peaks and Noe Valley to the west and a rise of hills leading up to San Bruno Mountain in the south. People come and run their dogs here and watch eclipses, sunrises, sunsets, the Blue Angels and wildlife. There's been a celebrated coyote since 2003; recent sightings confirm it's still there. There are nooks and crannies and stairs and weeds and it's a big, big, well-loved back yard.","geo":{"lat":37.74315,"lon":-122.41482,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25333,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
