It was renovated several years ago and now it's a great example of Bay Area &quot;foodie&quot; culture. Inside you'll find little shops selling artisanal bread (Acme), cheese (Cowgirl), chocolate (e.g., Tcho, Recchiuti, Ghiradelli, Scharffen Berger, etc.), slow-drip coffee (Blue Bottle), and so on. There's even a stand selling vegan donuts! There are also a few excellent little restaurants and specialty markets as well as a large [http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/merchant_list.php farmers market] out front (Tuesdays and Saturdays year-round and on Thursday evenings in the summer). Together with its surroundings, the Ferry Building is beautiful to see, especially at night (although the shops will be closed at night). It's a popular place to visit for downtown office workers and tourists alike.","geo":{"lat":37.7955,"lon":-122.3934,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":26171,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
