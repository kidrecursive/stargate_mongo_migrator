At the museum you get to enjoy the beautiful exhibits and learn about the processes that formed them and the geology of the sites where they were mined. Created and maintained through a partnership between the city council and the [http://www.mineralogie-chamonix.org/ local Mineralogical club], it is both very aesthetic and scientific, displaying pedagogical posters. There is also a smaller crystal museum with free entrance in a cave next to Montenvers station and Mer du Glace, but you need to take the rack rail up or hike.","geo":{"lat":45.92448,"lon":6.8676,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":5309,"country":"France","city":"Chamonix-Mont-Blanc","state":"Rhône-Alpes"}
