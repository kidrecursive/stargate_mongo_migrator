The decor isn't as fancy as more expensive places, but it has charm. The menu is family style, so one order is enough to feed two people. Like most Korean BBQ places, servers bring the meat out for you to cook at your table (but that doesn't mean you shouldn't tip!) With your meal comes a variety of traditional Korean side dishes and a plate of julienned scallions to enjoy with your freshly grilled meat. For finicky eaters or those new to Korean food, the bulgoki (marinated beef) is always a good choice. On warmer days, or whenever you want a lighter meal, try their cold noodle soup (white somen noodles in a cold soup of clear, mild kimchi) with your meal instead of rice.","geo":{"lat":34.056262,"lon":-118.289831,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":16694,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
