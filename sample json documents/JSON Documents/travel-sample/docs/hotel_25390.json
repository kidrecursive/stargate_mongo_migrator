Like other reviewers, we had a disappointingly small room and tiny bathroom, but the main issue was noise. Like some other reviewers we were in a room with an interconnecting door to the next room, which increased the transfer of noise that was loud enough coming through the walls - we could hear every conversation (and 3 a.m. argument) of our fellow guests. The little things also disappointed: frayed bath towels, the closet door not opening fully as it was up against the bed, and not the view of the financial district we had been promised. For $220 all this was just not good enough; all in all an old hotel trading on its reputation not the reality.","ratings":{"Service":-1.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":2.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Mason Koepp","date":"2012-08-23 16:57:56 +0300"}],"public_likes":[],"vacancy":false,"description":"An upscale bed and breakfast in a restored house.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":true}
