Staple Inn was built in 1585 and served as an inn Inn of Chancery (law school).  Most of it escaped both the Great Fire and the German air raids, unlike other buildings in the area. The western end is actually from a different, adjoining buildingâ€”which was incorporated into the Inn with a unified facade during restoration work in 1936, although the difference can still be seen in the roofing and slightly different style.  One of Charles Dickens's homes was on the site and it featured in his ''Mystery of Edwin Drood''. | image=Staple Inn, London, UK - 20050821.jpg","geo":{"lat":51.5179,"lon":-0.1111,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16189,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Staple_Inn%2C_London%2C_UK_-_20050821.jpg"}
