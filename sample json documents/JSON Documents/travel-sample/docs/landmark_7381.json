The main route consists of 27 miles of dirt road, beginning at the Ubehebe Crater in the northern part of the park.  However, the effort is well-rewarded with a site of twilight-zone proportions.  The Plestiocene-era lake bed, nearly three miles long and a mile wide, is so flat that it once used as a landing strip for drug smugglers. But the Racetrack is most famous for its &quot;moving rocks&quot;: boulders whose erratic tracks remain visible for years. Though their movement has been tracked with GPS, no adequate explanation for it has been found. In the spring months, brine shrimp - which hibernate when the water dries up, only to emerge months or even years later - are sometimes visible in the muddy puddles here.","geo":{"lat":36.69272,"lon":-117.56644,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":7381,"country":"United States","city":"Inyo County","state":"California"}
