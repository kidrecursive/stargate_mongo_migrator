The citadel is up on the Hoe, with massive walls which you will no doubt see as you walk along the seafront road. The Citadel is still used as a military base, for the army's 29 Commando Regiment, Royal Artillery. Although it is a Ministry of Defence site, the fort is open for guided tours at 2.30pm on Tuesdays (and in summer, also on Thursdays at same time). Meet outside the entrance on Lambhay Hill, where the military sentry is.","geo":{"lat":50.363889,"lon":-4.136165,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":22549,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Plymouth","state":null}
