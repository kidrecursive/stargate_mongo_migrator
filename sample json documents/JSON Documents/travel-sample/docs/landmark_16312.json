The permanent exhibition follows the change in British homes from the early 20th century until present day, which is constantly updated to include new design classics. There are temporary exhibits which run for 3-4 months. Recent exhibits have included Saul Bass, Peter Saville and Archigram. The museum also runs ''Designer of the Year'' which awards a prize to a person or organisation that has produced an impressive piece of design (past winner was Jonathan Ive, who designed the iMac and iPod). There is a small shop that has plenty of art and design books as well as designer goods to take home with you.","geo":{"lat":51.5027,"lon":-0.07197,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16312,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null}
