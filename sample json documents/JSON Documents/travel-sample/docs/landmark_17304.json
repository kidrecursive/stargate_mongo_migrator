A great family place with a stocked bar","content":"On its own private beach, the ONLY beach in all of Southern California that allows alcohol. Has a private picnic area with tables and chairs, no need to purchase food from the restaurant. There is parking which you need to pay, you can get your ticket validated inside. The atmosphere is great and the food is pretty good, this is the local hot spot for people of all ages. Romantic enough for a date but fun enough for the whole family. Can get very, very crowded in the morning so call ahead and make your reservation (probably a good idea regardless of the time slot).","geo":{"lat":34.02019,"lon":-118.7871,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":17304,"country":"United States","city":"Malibu","state":"California"}
