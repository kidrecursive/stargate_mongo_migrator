We stayed there prior to a cruise. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We arrived at Marco Polo Aeroport...took a bus ( right out in front of the terminal 3Euros) to Piazzale Roma (about 10 min) Then took the Vaporetto to our hotel (second stop). We bought a 48 hr vaporetto pass for 28 euros which allowed us to get around quite easily. When it was time to go to the cruise ship...we were able to take the Vaporetto right to the mooring. The location of the hotel was very quiet and being so close to the Vaporetto we were able to move around Venice quickly.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Holden Heathcote","date":"2013-09-06 14:44:39 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Eula Rolfson","Harry Batz","Imani Okuneva","Lina Glover","Caterina Bechtelar","Opal Hudson","Quentin Collier","Tomasa Johnston","Orpha Eichmann"],"vacancy":false,"description":"The Britannia Sachas is a popular hotel located near Manchester city centre.
