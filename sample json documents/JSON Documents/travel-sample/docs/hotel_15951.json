The room was okay but could certainly use some renovations especially the bathrooms. We only stayed there one night and thankfully so. Our room was right next to the elevator and very close to the pool, so very noisy from other guests walking by all hours of the night. However, the hotel is in a good location. Close to lots of restaurants and sites to see.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Garland Lind","date":"2015-08-24 10:14:41 +0300"},{"content":"The best thing about this hotel is its location. It is across the street from San Juan bay. A short walk takes one into the heart of old San Juan and all the cafÃ©s, restaurants, night spots, small museums and historic spots. The problems with this hotel are mostly due to historic reasons. The fact that the building in which its housed goes back to a different area and wasn't meant as a hotel means that it has no parking of its own. There is, however, a municipal parking across the street at the side of the building, and another a block away. Rates are quite reasonable (Don't use the hotel's valet parking. They use the very same municipal parking, but charge four times as much!). Also because of cramped space, amenities are on the smallish size, but quite adequate. For example, the pool is on the roof and not large, meant to dip in, not swim. On the other hand, they've made it pleasant. On the bright side, they've used their imagination to squeeze in as many amenities as possible in the cramped space. Thus, in addition to the pool, the hotel has a comparatively large fitness room, a restaurant, conference rooms, a bar-and-burger joint and, of course, the casino. The decor is simple, but nice. Very simple, the color schemes being bright pastels (Y'know, the whole tropical thing). Room furniture is on the theme of the austere, dark Spanish colonial look, simple but quite adequate. I personally liked it. The room is comfortably sized. Air conditioned worked fine (A blessing in the tropics), the bathroom larger than in most hotels and well appointed. The whole of the hotel was kept very clean. Tickets were given to me when I checked in for a full buffet breakfast free, with waffles and omelettes cooked to order. There were enough for me and my daughter to cover every morning of our stay. The food was good, the service personnel very pleasant. Rates were reasonable, particularly so for Puerto Rico and especially considering the hotel's location. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, and would definitely return.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Deron Herzog","date":"2015-02-19 07:48:27 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Marcel Steuber","Clinton Miller","Clyde Hodkiewicz","Miracle Stracke IV","Mike Morar"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Adcote House is a 4-star bed and breakfast that offers comfortable bedrooms and suites for adults only.
