You can obviously also explore the regular range of Peugeot cars and purchase one, as well as an extensive range of Peugeot merchandise from the on-site &quot;boutique Peugeot&quot;, including the Peugeot condiment grinders the company makes for much longer than it does build cars.","geo":{"lat":48.8727,"lon":2.2996,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"buy","type":"landmark","id":21822,"country":"France","city":"Paris","state":"Île-de-France"}
