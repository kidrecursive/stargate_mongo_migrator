In its early years, the mission suffered due to violence among the Indians. The original mission buildings (save one) fell down in an 1857 earthquake, and in their place was built a Catholic Church with the anglicized name Holy Cross Church. However, a replica of the old mission was constructed nearby at half-scale in the 1930s by a wealthy benefactor, and it exists today as Santa Cruz Mission State Historic Park.","geo":{"lat":36.978112,"lon":-122.029423,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":37518,"country":"United States","city":"Santa Cruz","state":"California"}
