Streamside garden (slightly spoilt by oversized decking erected for the 2006 World Cup) with adventure playground, and Pullman railway coach converted into overnight accommodation. No public transport. Free house, decent food. Live music on Friday nights. Close to pretty hamlet of Rowarth, in good walking country (the streamside path north towards Higherfold Farm is particularly attractive).","geo":{"lat":53.3975,"lon":-1.9854,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":34933,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Derbyshire","state":null}
