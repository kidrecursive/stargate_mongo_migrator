The interior is warm and shadowy, a comfortable place of dark wood and golden lantern light, and the beer selection is good; you can get pints of Belhaven or Newcastle as well as the ubiquitous Guinness, and it's all available by the pitcher. The Edinburgh Castle also has a relationship with a local fish and chips fryer, so you can order from their menu and have it delivered to you at the pub. The jukebox is well stocked with punk rock, Irish folk/rock, and American roots music, and live bands also play regularly (which can unfortunately make it impossible to carry on a conversation). A trivia contest is held on Tuesday nights. And on Burns Night (January 25th), the Edinburgh Castle is ''the'' place to be, with ribald poetry readings, music, and a public haggis.","geo":{"lat":37.7862,"lon":-122.419,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":25567,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
