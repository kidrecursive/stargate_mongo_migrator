Lines at the restaurant lasted for hours so Walter Knott built a ghost town to entertain the crowds, and this eventually evolved into the theme park. True to its history, Mrs. Knott's is an extremely popular place to eat and usually has long lines so plan to arrive early. The menu features traditional American fare with the specialty being the fried chicken and buttermilk biscuits. In general, no reservations are accepted except for the Sunday brunch and for parties of 12 or more.For Brunch Reservations call (714) 220-5055.","geo":{"lat":33.842974,"lon":-117.998165,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":4392,"country":"United States","city":"Buena Park","state":"California"}
