Davidson Park (which boasts the highest point in San Francisco) offers great hiking trails. Mt. Davidson's most distinguishing feature is a 6-story cross nestled among the many eucalyptus trees, which can be seen from various spots in the city depending on which angle youÂ´re looking from. It was constructed as part of the WPA program of the 1930s, and is the site of a sunrise mass every Easter. At the peak, you're rewarded with great views of downtown and the bay.","geo":{"lat":37.7387,"lon":-122.4539,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":26146,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
