If you look closely you can read the name Coronado in the sand dunes close to the Hotel del Coronado. A small tidepool area in front of the Hotel Del gives you a chance to explore a bit. There's plenty of free parking along Ocean Blvd, but it fills up quickly during the summer. At the north end of the beach, up by Sunset Park, the beach is open to dogs as well as bonfire pits and surfing. Surfing is also allowed in-front of the &quot;Shores&quot; just south of the Hotel Del. Lifeguards on duty seasonally. Restrooms and showers available.","geo":{"lat":32.68306,"lon":-117.18376,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":6918,"country":"United States","city":"Coronado","state":"California"}
