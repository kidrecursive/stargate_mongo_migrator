The site sits on the ridgeway long distance footpath, which follows the line of a chalk ridge which separates the berkshire downs to the south and the vale of the white horse to the north. The horse has been cut into the chalk downs can be seen from miles around. It has been &quot;cleaned&quot; by local communities about every 20 years continuously since it was first made about 2000 to 3000 years ago. The hill fort consists of a large circular bank and ditch about 1&nbsp;km to 1 mile in circumference, with grass all over and inside. There are great views from the site, which is fantastic for pic-nics on a sunny day. Also nearby is the Dragon's hill which appears to be man made and could somehow be associated to the site.Access is feasible most easily by car - with two car parks. (one of which is nearer the horse and recommended only for visitors requiring easier access) The lower car park includes some signage explaining the Whitehorse, and ridgeway. There are picnic tables near by. One could also easily take in the White Horse and Hill Fort, on a walk along the ridgeway.","geo":{"lat":51.574602,"lon":-1.571416,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":28964,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Oxfordshire","state":null}
