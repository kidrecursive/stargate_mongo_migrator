Just go there for a drink or two, or book a table in the restaurant area to try the ecelectic cajun-inspired menu, or check out the events listings - they have already hosted a range of gigs from folk to country to dance to rock, as well as comedy and theatre. Currently 'the' place to be seen, and for a change, lives up to the tag.","geo":{"lat":55.9538,"lon":-3.19068,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":8610,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Edinburgh","state":null}
