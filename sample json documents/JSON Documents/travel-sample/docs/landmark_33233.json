If you like the '80s L.A. metal scene, there's no better place to spot rock stars (and lesser lights like Ron Jeremy.)  A $10 cover charge comes with two drink vouchers.  The Roxy is next door. A crowded outdoor smoking patio is available for the real rockers.","geo":{"lat":34.090769,"lon":-118.388208,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":33233,"country":"United States","city":"West Hollywood","state":"California"}
