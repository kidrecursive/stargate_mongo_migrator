Matthew Boulton used the Mill for making buttons and for metal rolling until he moved his operations to Soho in 1761. In the late 1890s Sarehole was the childhood haunt of Hobbit author J.R.R. Tolkien, and famously influenced 'The Shire' in ''The Lord of the Rings''. Check the website for special events. A short 5 minute walk away is Moseley Bog [http://www.moseleybog.org.uk/] a woodland said to have inspired Fangorn Forest.","geo":{"lat":52.4344,"lon":-1.8561,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":3501,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Birmingham","state":null}
