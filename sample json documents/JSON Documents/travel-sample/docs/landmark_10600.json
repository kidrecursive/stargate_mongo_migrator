Both number 1 and 2 courses have been used for qualifying for the Open Championship. Much easier to get a round here compared to Muirfield, but you should still book in advance. Various different deals available throughout the year - check the website. Whilst it's the shortest of the three courses, No. 3 isn't regarded as the 'poor relation' of Nos. 1& 2, with many commentators remarking on its challenging nature. The three 18-hole courses all start from the Western edge of the village, with the children's course (adults only allowed when accompanied by a child!) accessed from the old village green, a short way along the high street.  Bear in mind that there are a wealth of golf courses all along the coastline of East Lothian, virtually one in every town or village.","geo":{"lat":56.02906,"lon":-2.85019,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":10600,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Gullane","state":null}
