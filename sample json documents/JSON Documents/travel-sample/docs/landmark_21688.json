Make sure you go on a sunny day, as the highlight of this small chapel in Rayonnante Gothic style are the large stained-glass windows which soar up to near the vaulted ceiling. Also of interest is the extremely ornate lower level. If it happens to be rainy or cloudy, give Sainte-Chapelle a miss, as the play of coloured lights on the floor are well worth the wait for a sunnier day. As the chapelle is inside the Courts of Justice, there will thus be a security check.","geo":{"lat":48.85533,"lon":2.34514,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":21688,"country":"France","city":"Paris","state":"Île-de-France","image_direct_url":""}
