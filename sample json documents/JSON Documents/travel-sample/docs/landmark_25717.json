It's a great place to unwind, have a picnic, and watch the swans float elegantly by. It also has a theater offering a variety of shows, musical and cultural events. As of July 2008, it is being renovated.","geo":{"lat":37.8029,"lon":-122.4484,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25717,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
