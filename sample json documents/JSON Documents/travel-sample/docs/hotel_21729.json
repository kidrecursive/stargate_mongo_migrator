The place is basically the \"Grandest\" hotel in probably the grandest resort (Wailea) on probably the best Hawian island. We went at the begining of Sept and it was only a thrid full which was great as busy but just nice, you could always get loungers, always got served quickly etc whereas we spoke to some people who had been there during the main weeks and they said it was bedlam and too busy so avoid then if possble. Hotel itself is huge with some grand rooms - the lobby and main bar area is impressive, with certain areas open to the elements and just oozes class. Rooms very spacious and very comfortable with flat screen tv's, mini bars and all other mod cons - bathroom was loved by my wife as has huge bath and at least a double sized walk in shower, 2 sinks etc etc etc. One of the main reasons we loved it so much was the pool areas; several pools starting at the top of the hill that have different slides (fast, twisty, straight leading into lazy river through ravine) that you just work your way through until you eventually come t the pool bar where \"you have to have a mudslide cocktail\" and then flow through the lazy river that takes you metres from the beachfront and then if you see fit back up to the top on a water elevator. For adults and bigger kids only who want fast slides, there are 2 big slides that go from top to bottom quickly that are great fun. Food at the hotel and neigbouring hotels (Fairmont & Four Seasons) plus \"The shops at Wailea\" is out of this world, good sized portions and sea food to die for (I think i ate the Pacifics stock of Scallops and Shrimp). The only downside is that this holiday aint a cheap one. The Grand Wailea dont seem to discount and only offer room only and the local restaurants as mentioned above costs best part of $200 per meal (2 adults and one child, starter, main and couple drinks) but i guess you get what you pay for. 10 mins drive away are cheaper restaurants and good supermarkets that you should definately use to stock up your water, drinks, snacks etc as they are probably only 25% of the price you pay at the hotel. Would i go there again - most definately and to be honest would kind of live with the cost if it was not for the 10 hour flight to the West Coast of America followed by a further 6 hours to Maui. Only regret - great golf courses just 5 mins away and didnt play !! Conclusion - pure class, treat yourself as a must do in a lifetime experience","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":3.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Torrance Kub","date":"2013-06-02 03:03:40 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed at the Grand Wailea for 6 nights and stayed in an ocean view room in the Chapel Wing. The room overlooked the small chapel at the hotel where weddings take place. It is surrounded by a pond with giant fish that my kids loved to feed. We could also see some of the ocean. The gardens of the hotel are the highlight as they obviously spared no expense in landscaping the grounds. The hotel is a masterpiece. The open air lobby is magnificent and the fitness center is the nicest I have ever seen in a hotel. The problem is you pay a heavy price to stay here and I am not sure it is worth it. We booked our room through an opthalmology meeting that was there in order to get a meeting rate. We still paid 400 dollars a night, plus multiple fees were added on including an 18 dollar a day \"resort fee\" supposedly to cover our access to the swimming pools and fitness center. The food and drink prices are prohibitively expensive. They charged my children 8 dollars each for a frozen lemonade at the pool restaurant. A minimal lunch for 3 was over 70 dollars (at the pool). We ended up eating every meal at restaurants in Kihei. They even charged us 25 dollars to rent a small fridge for the week as the rooms have a fridge, but it is full of high priced snacks and drinks and is locked unless you opt for the \"self service bar\" option. The rooms were nice, but not exceptional for the price. The swimming pools were so cold that it was unpleasant to swim in them. There were no organized pool activities and no drink service at the pools. The beach was great and well maintained. The staff was pleasant but not overly friendly. The nicest person I met there was the maid for our room. They did respond quickly when or toilet clogged. The whole place had an air of pretentiousness about it. I think the only people who can afford it are foreigners who's currency is strong against the dollar. I struggled daily to find a parking place big enough for my rented minivan in the under sized self park garage that was quite a hike to my room. The garage by the front of the hotel is valet parking only. When I return to Maui I will stay somewhere more reasonable as the main attraction to the Grand Wailea is the many pools and its location. I think there are other hotels that would offer the same for less.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Check in / front desk":4.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Delilah Schaefer","date":"2015-09-28 02:40:43 +0300"},{"content":"I have been coming to Wailea since 1993 and have always wanted to stay at the Grand Wailea. This year my conference had it's meetings at the hotel. Usually I have always stayed at the now defunct Renaissance Hotel 2 hotels north. For all the hype I've heard and the prices, I was expecting to be wowed. Unfortunately I was underwowed. I am a Diamond member within the Hilton Hotel system and the front desk notified me that I was upgraded to a deluxe ocean view for which I am grateful. When I asked where self parking was, they told me \"a quarter mile down the road\". This wasn't as bad as it sounded as you can walk most of it through the hotel. The bad part is there is very little parking and the spaces are sized for Mini Coopers. I was glad I turned down the upgrade to a Cadillac as I would never have parked. Vallet parking is $20/night. I arrived to my room on the 7th floor of the Wailea wing at the distal third of the wing. Nice view of the ocean and quiet until last night when a noisy family arrived above me at midnight. The room was spacious and has a nice marble bathroom and tub. 2 robes are provided, but no slippers. I've never been to a Hilton here in the states or around the world that didn't have slippers. When I called housekeeping they said slippers \"were only for VIPs\", but they brought me some anyway. Being a diamond member (which is the highest level of Hilton's frequent guest program) apparently didn't count. The Waldorf-Astoria collection is part of the Hilton Family. The coffee in the room and at the Grand Dining room is truly awful. The second worst coffee I've ever had after a Holiday Inn in Souzhou, China. My next problem was the internet connection. I spent about 3 hours with Lodgenet (the hotel's internet support in Atlanta, GA) and 2 of the engineering employees here at the hotel. Finally, we took my computer to the next room that worked perfectly and the engineer took that modem and placed it in my room and I finally had service. The engineer here at the hotel didn't seem to understand computers very well, and the support staff at Lodgenet couldn't figure out the issue. The breakfast buffet came with my room and the setting is beautiful overlooking the grounds and ocean. A egg bar is there for personalized eggs of any sort. There is a Japanese bar with miso soup, rice and condiments. Hot foods with sablefish alternating without another fish which are both overcooked and dry. Sliced potatoes alternating with hash browns, Bacon, and a meat hash. There is also waffles, fruit selections, salad ingredients and some really good smoked salmon daily. Breads are massed produced and taste like it. The buffet is $28/person.The day I arrived the major pools were shut down for renovation and only the Hibiscus Pool is currently open. There are 2 jacuzzis with this open until 10PM. The beach is one of the best on Maui. Unfortunately, being at the front of the property from the pool down to the beach is also the area that you can hear the generators for the workers. They are there everyday during all daylight hours. If you want to enjoy the beach and not hear construction noise you can walk to the Fairmont further south (the Four Seasons next store shares the same beach and has the same noise pollution). Otherwise, you can go north to the beach that was in front of the Renaissance. This is pretty deserted because the hotel is now closed. The staff is friendly and the housekeeping staff is cleaning my rooms well. As the previous reviewer noted, I also haven't received bar soap since my last one was used. The scented Mango/coconut lotion/shampoo etc smells good, but the shampoo made my hair feel \"rough\" and not clean. Overall, I am enjoying my stay after getting around all the hiccups, but to me the physical plant is similar to what the Renaissance was, not anything better. I checked out the Marriott next store and was disappointed. They had sold the Renaissance and moved here, but the rooms, amenities, quality is not at the level the Renaissance was. The Grand Spa they say is rated the best spa in the US by Conde Nast. Once again I was expecting to be wowed, and wasn't. It is very similar to the California Burke William Spas, but more expensive of course. The terme room is a nice concept, but when you think about 5 or 6 bathtubs with different solutions (like mud, seaweed etc) into which multiple people get in and out of after soaking for any length of time, it's like sharing your bathtub at home with multiple people you don't know.","ratings":{"Overall":4.0},"author":"Lacey Cronin","date":"2015-10-06 11:04:54 +0300"},{"content":"The exterior or the grounds of Grand Wailea is beautiful! The moment you drive up you feel that you have arrived in paradise as you watch their mini waterfall. The hotel has all the amenities you need, just a walk to the pools, beach, nearby hotel restaurants, spa, & water activities. With all these positives the negative would be the price and the room. I think the price you pay should be relative to what you get. The hotel is overrated. It seems like they put all the money, near $500 a night they charge the customers with the upkeep of the exterior of the hotel and fell short with the actual rooms. We were assigned a room that was a bit of a walk to the beach and pool area. Our room's view was facing the self parking. If you are a very light sleeper like I am, try not to get a room assigned on this side. In the morning you can kind of hear the trucks making their deliveries around 6am! The room itself, looks outdated. It is not terrible, its just descent. We expected more for the price. The hotel should put the money renovating their rooms. In regards to food, the only time we ate at the hotel was for breakfast from the cafe. The food lacked flavor. I ordered a waffle and my husband ordered a breakfast platter. It consists of eggs, sausage, bread roll, and a cup of rice. We didn't even order any drinks and we paid about $38. Again, the price is definitely NOT relative to the overall stay. My suggestion is to book a room at a nearby hotel and walk over to Grand Wailea to take pictures.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":2.0},"author":"Ambrose Hahn","date":"2014-05-24 04:36:52 +0300"},{"content":"Some of the reviews would make you think there are two different parts of the hotel...while we haven;t stayed in every resort in Hawaii, this is the best so far out of 4 resorts at different islands...the place was immaculate, room was very clean, no signs of wear and large enough for 2 adults with 2 adult teenagers. Didnt see the problems others claim and were at the resort at almost the same time. As a Diamond VIP, we were upgraded to the 9th (top floor) with a full ocean view...was a great view, the staff were very nice, place was very clean...grounds were well kept. Like any other resort, food and drink are pricey but unlike other resorts you get free parking, free internet, no daily resort fee which can be anywhere from 10-25 dollars per day. I normally wouldn't say that I would like to return to a particular place just cause we like to explore others but will return to this resort as one to go to in Maui. We stayed at the Hilton last year in Hawaii...nice but way too big and hard to get around...these grounds were laid out nicely, short walk to pools and beach, nice water front paths for daily walks..just a great place to relax... like any other place, there is a costco nearby so loading up on drinks and snacks is worth it... if your booked don't let the bad reviews get you down...you will be happy with your stay...enjoy!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":3.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Oswald Gleichner","date":"2015-08-06 04:20:31 +0300"},{"content":"The Grand Wailea is an unbelievable resort! On this trip it was only my wife and I. Next time i will bring my two children. I have never stayed in a resort as completely overwhelming in class as The Grand. Do know that it would be really tough to stay here on a budget. Everything, especially the food, is pricey. We checked in on Sunday, July 20th, and took advantage of the Sunday Brunch. It was $48 per person. It was amazing. The next day we ate Sushi at Kincha's. Two buffets and an additional Rainbow Roll, plus a tea and glass of wine and we walked out the door for $160. The sushi, even for a buffet, was as good as I have ever had. For lunch another day we ate at the pool and for two wraps, two bottle waters, one smoothie, a mixed drink, plus tip and we signed a ticket for $70. In case you are wondering, all of the food and drinks are tops, but you get what you pay for. The view from my 8th floor room was breathtaking of the grounds and ocean. My advice is to request a room on an upper floor. I have included pictures of the room and restroom and our view. The beds, pillows, and linens are very satisfying. There are no rooms in any of the buildings that don't face the ocean, but the lower the floor the more trees to look over. The Spa Grande is well worth every penny. For a 2:00 appointment they have you arrive at 1:00 to take advantage of all the other amenities that you have available. There are different baths, whirlpools, etc that are intended to help you relax before your massage or other. The service is very impressive. The pool is tremendous. If you are thinking if your children would be entertained at the Grand, you need to know the pool is like a miniature water park. There are slides, one as long as 180 feet, a rapids slide, a water elevator, zero entry for the little ones, and a volleyball net in the larger pool. Thre is a lazy river but bring you own floatation devices because they are not provided. Some comments about the pool being crowded made me fear not getting a chair. There was never a problem when my wife and I were ready to find a place. Reference my pictures for some views of the pools. By design the hotel's rooms are a comfortable distance from the pools. Upon my check in, while looking toward the back, you can't see the pools. It isn't too far, just hidden a bit. I will be going back to The Grand Wailea. I stayed three nights at a condo prior to my checking in to The Grand and the difference in overall experience was like winning the lottery. As a whole, my experience in the area stores and shops was not the friendliest experiences. I would say most tourist places employees get tired of people. The Grandâ€™s employees are there to serve you. The only inconvenience in staying here is that you have to go down to the 4th floor, walk across the lobby area to get to another elevator to get from the 4th floor down. Not a huge deal, but a little time consuming. I am posting pictures so you can see some areas of the property.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Myrtice Pacocha","date":"2012-06-04 00:23:26 +0300"},{"content":"One can tell that this used to be a special place. But now the construction crews are roaming around and corridors here and there are closed for repair. The wheels of the housekeeping carts rumble loudly early in the AM on the tile floors. The food is ultra expensive (even for HI standards) and run of the mill. Feels like a Vegas hotel (one in need of a few million $ in upgrades) planted in a pristine spot. We were there for an awards trip and the lobby bar closed before 12 each night. When it was open, we found the informative and friendly help there the highlight of the stay. Other staff couldn't be bothered, for the most part. Upon arrival after a terrible delay en route the bellman asked \"do you really need help with your bags?\" Would never pay to stay there when the outstanding Four Seasons is just up the road - a bit higher in rates for Ocean view rooms.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Neva Quitzon","date":"2012-06-26 16:27:33 +0300"},{"content":"After looking forward to a week of sheer luxury, the Grand Wailea was a massive disappointment. Things did not get off to a good start when we arrived tired and jet lagged at 12 noon off a flight from Japan and asked whether we could check in earlier than the normal 3pm time. The front desk said that they would contact housekeeping to get our room ready early and took our mobile phone number, so they could tell us when the room was ready. Two hours passed with no contact, so we went back to the front desk. They assured us that the room was being given the express treatment. Three o'clock came and went, and at around 3:15pm we were taken by a bell hop to a filthy room which hadn't been touched. The bell hop rang down to the front, who said that they had given us the wrong room. Eventually, we were placed in the right room and the bell hop fled from embarrassment without explaining any of the room's facilities and without hanging around for a tip (the one and only time at our stay in the resort). My sense from was that housekeeping had no intention of getting a room ready before 3pm and we were just fobbed off by the front desk. After unpacking, we headed down to the pool. The place was packed. Not a free chair in sight. When we turned up poolside the next day around 10am, the same situation. This is where I part company with all those four and five star reviews for this same hotel I have read. In a true luxury hotel, you do not have to fight for a pool side seat, you do not have to rush down to the pool at the crack of dawn to place your towel on a seat, you do not have to pay $100 a day to reserve a bit of shade. This is not what a luxury hotel does. This is what a mass market, mid-level or worse hotel does. Indeed, the hotel seemed intent on gouging clients at every turn. From internet access, to umbrellas on the beach, to the daily resort charge (what is this? surely when you book a room at the price of this hotel, you assume that you will be using the resort facilities). Finally, the food was truly terrible value for money. We tried the Bistro Molokini, Grand Dining Room, Cafe Kula and the Japanese restaurant Kincha. In every case you got second rate food for around two to four times the price you would pay in a good city restaurant. Everything appeared to be out a tin, instant mix or the freezer. Given everything has to be shipped into Maui, I can see the limitations. But true luxury hotels that have island locations around the world like the Four Seasons work around this - that is why you pay big bucks: so as to get good, well cooked fresh food. At the Grand Wailea you pay big bucks to get tarted-up school canteen slop. Finally, I got caught up in the airline bankrupcty problems during my stay and had to switch my flight out to Hawaiin Airlines from Aloha. Stupidly, I thought that I could use the Grand Wailea's clout to help navigate my way through all the ticketing chaos rather than waste a whole day on the phone and internet. Of course, they were not interested in helping (even up to the Day Manager level). Again the contrast with a real luxury hotel is telling: in such hotels, the senior people at the front desk have a degree of autonomy and flexiblity in problem solving for clients. At the Grand Wailea, if it is not in their rule book, they are not interested. In conclusion, for all those people who have rated this hotel highly (and for the senior management of the Grand Wailea who don't appear to get it), all I can say is try a true luxury hotel. It costs the same you know. The experience you will have at the Mandarin, Peninsula, Four Seasons and Shangri-la is at a completely different level. Amazingly, the Waldorf Astoria has lent its brand to the Grand Wailea. I don't know what they are thinking. This is a classic way to damage a luxury brand. It fooled me into booking this hotel once, but not again! And now I will also think twice about booking any Waldorf Astoria worldwide.","ratings":{"Overall":1.0},"author":"Noemie Bartell","date":"2014-10-06 17:04:24 +0300"},{"content":"Well, having read about how the Grand Wailea needed renovations; about how everything costs so much and nickel and diming; having read about no HHonors privileges, and kids running rampant, I had set pretty low expectations about this trip. Fortunately, my experience was the opposite of all those negative reviews! We booked 6 nights for 300,000 HHonors points, and paid $500/night for two additional nights. I expected no upgrade, but we were upgraded to Napua Tower; I expected no HHonors \"perks\" but was immediately recognized as a Diamond member, given $25 certificate for use at Molokini Bistro, and 20% discount certificate for the spa - as well, as a welcoming letter from the manager (which said, by the way \"If you're Diamond or Gold, and we haven't been able to give you a free upgrade, you will be given other options and additional HHonors points.\" I expected moldy carpets and furniture, peeling wallpaper, and dirty tile grout in the bathroom, but got a beautifully furnished, exceptionally maintained, spacious ocean-view room - my wife was especially happy that we could sit on the lanai and see Molokini, and watch whales. I expected to be charged extra for taking a deep breath, but, really found nothing out of line with any other top-line resort. Yeah, $18 for a burger is on the high side, but, look where you get to eat it! Maybe it was just the time of our visit, but, while we saw lots of kids, they certainly were neither pervasive, nor pests. We loved the idea that there was an adult pool - with lounges available as late as 9:30 in the morning (we were never unable to find a pair near the pool) and kids were over in there's doing whatever they wanted to do. Seems Hibiscus was heated, and activity pools were not, but they were certainly not uncomfortable - and at least as warm as the ocean! The staff was friendly and helpful, the facility was beautiful and comfortable. Loved the Hospitality Suite for shower and changing clothes on last day - we checked out of our room at 2:00 PM and stayed by the pool until 5:00 PM - and easily caught our 9:40 PM flight home. And, for those who think Wailea is too haughty, I believe you've got it wrong. Wailea is maintained and manicured, for sure, but the people and the facilities are as friendly and outgoing there as anywhere on the island. And, they tolerate rednecks like me!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Wilbert Brown","date":"2013-07-07 18:51:30 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Lavern Oberbrunner","Santina Aufderhar DDS","Elmira Ortiz","Damion Walter I","Mrs. Alex Von","Dallas Lubowitz"],"vacancy":false,"description":"This charming 3 star hotel is next to the Place Vendome and 2 minutes walk from the Opera Garnier and famous Parisian department stores.
