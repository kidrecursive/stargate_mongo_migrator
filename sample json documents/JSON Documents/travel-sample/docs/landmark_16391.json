It still mainly caters for a classical audience, but it also hosts many other varied events including the odd contemporary rock/pop acts, and its corridors are sometimes used as exhibition spaces. During July–September the Albert Hall hosts the '''BBC Proms'''. This British national institution is a series of nightly classical concerts with world-leading performers for which standing tickets can be bought on the door on the night for as little as £5.","geo":{"lat":51.50105,"lon":-0.17748,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":16391,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":""}
