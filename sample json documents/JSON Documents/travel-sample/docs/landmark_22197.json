Where you can now see the Palace, built early 19th century, stood once the Abbot's Palace. You can see a replica of the '''Stone of Destiny''', upon which the kings were crowned. The original stone was thought to have been stolen by Edward I and brought to London, but some believe the original was hidden by its guardians and that the English king was given a locally quarried substitute. A few years ago this stone was finally returned to Scotland and now resides in [[Edinburgh]] Castle. Visitors more interested in medieval history might not want to buy the rather expensive ticket for the Palace, but you can walk around the park on a cheaper ticket. The Palace offers an extensive collection of 17th and 18th century '''Ivories''' in the State Dining Rooms, 18th century French furniture, a big collection of Porcelain, '''Queen Victoria's''' boudoir and information of the Scottish kings.","geo":{"lat":56.42301,"lon":-3.43856,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":22197,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Stable Yd","state":null}
