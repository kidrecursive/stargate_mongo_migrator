Still an endearingly warren-like building, with the ''Great Hall'' at its heart an impressive sight, especially at Christmas-time. Has a franchise of London's famous ''Hamleys'' toyshop in the basement.","geo":{"lat":55.95273,"lon":-3.19375,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"buy","type":"landmark","id":8586,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Edinburgh","state":null}
