This popular eatery uses local, organic produce to assemble fresh and healthy salads and soups, as well as delectable hot dishes from the grill, such as free-range chicken, Angus flatiron steak, and line-caught tuna. This eco-conscious restaurant also uses biodegradable to-go containers, reclaimed timber, and non-toxic cleaners. The atmosphere is relaxed and beautiful, with a spacious patio for outdoor dining.  Portions are large, and a wide array of boutique wines and microbrews will please any palate. Friendly service.","geo":{"lat":34.02318,"lon":-118.39494,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":7048,"country":"United States","city":"Culver City","state":"California"}
