The stylish indoor-outdoor tables share space with the hotel's pool, lively bar and its constant wave of partygoers and socialites. Lunch begets a more casual mood, whereas nighttime is primarily the right time as the hotel bar/pool/restaurant kicks into high gear. Food-wise, it's modern American cuisine galore and reaches a level of top-tier flavor one might not expect going in. Cool music, lounge-style vibe and good food makes for an enjoyable experience. The scallop and celery root risotto is a menu highlight.","geo":{"lat":34.059124,"lon":-118.39721,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":3403,"country":"United States","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"California"}
