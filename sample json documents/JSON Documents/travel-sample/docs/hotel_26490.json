Upon check-in I was told to present a card â€œjust in case of extra chargesâ€�. I did present a personal Check card, as I did not anticipate and did not acquire any additional charges. I specifically asked the person at the front desk if my card will be charged and he replied â€œno, unless you charge something extraâ€�. On check-out I was given a receipt for the total charge without identifying where the funds come from. Naturally I assumed that was the receipt for the hotel charge that should have occurred 10 days before. Subsequently, I found out that my personal card was charged for the amount. Since this is the card I use to pay bills with, now I am absorbing NSF charges from my bank for payments Iâ€™ve made. When I called I was refused access to Management by the employee at the front desk. She admitted that mistake was made by the person who checked me out, but refuse to remedy the situation promptly and told me she will attend to this at the end of her shift. That was clearly unacceptable for me and when I asked again to speak to a Manager, she hung-up the phone and did not pick-up for the next several times I tried to call. I am profoundly disappointed by the service and treatment I received. My experience was badly tainted by this incident. I would never return, there is a complete lack of accoutability and resposability. Worst staff ever.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Location":2.0,"Rooms":1.0},"author":"Gabriel Daniel","date":"2013-07-02 18:51:33 +0300"},{"content":"A little boutique hotel convient to Westwood and UCLA near Culver City with major shopping. Attentive to details and comfort. Lovely decorating. Comfort bedding! Beautiful details in the materials used for accomadations. Upscale, upbeat, contemporary. Quiet and private. Expect personal parking area that is narrow but adequate. The minus of nightlights in rooms, extra counter space and adequate lighting in bathrooms with towels for more than one; luggage racks and adequate in room coffee and access, should not discourage you if you ask for what you need. The owners and management are more than accommodating. There are other ammenties in hotel and rooms to free the traveler from stress and provide service of comfort and privacy. This boutique hotel opened in April 2008.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":2.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Grady Nikolaus","date":"2013-08-10 10:21:21 +0300"},{"content":"I stayed here twice mainly for the inexpensive price as well but the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. They also remembered me from the first time I stayed there. The staff is always up late at night if you come home late and have to give notice for a wake-up call. Rooms aren't fancy but quite adequate and quiet. You can actually hear water trickling from a nearby water fountain. They also have lots of free parking; a real benefit which most hotels don't have available. As one other reviewer said there's always a vacancy which is a benefit. It's in a great location only 2 miles from UCLA and Santa Monica. I'd stay again!","ratings":{"Overall":3.0},"author":"Cesar Bahringer","date":"2014-02-18 11:23:12 +0300"},{"content":"Stayed at the Wilson hotel for a week in January. The hotel has no public areas except a computer desk by the reception desk and a cafeteria that served full breakfast in the mornings and self service snacks and drinks until midnight. The rooms have a fake minimalistic decor on the cheap side but still they are clean and comfortable and considering this is a 3 star hotel they are more than adequate. We had a junior suite facing the north side of the hotel (not the diagonal) and a small balcony which was a bonus. Location was not bad and taxis are everywhere and cheap. Barcelona is a wonderful city with so many attractions, excellent restaurants and the people there are very friendly and proud of their city. Overall we had an excellent holiday in one of the most attractive cities in Europe.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Madalyn Roob","date":"2012-12-26 17:24:05 +0300"},{"content":"The room was a great value.
