No around-the-shoulder cuffed-sweaters, khaki pants, or tassle-loafer wearin' folks in this joint, but lots of friendly folks, and during Giants or 49ers games, cheers and boos can be heard from a good block away. One of the best views in the city is from out the back porch, which regrettably is now only open during the day. Not a quiet bar, but the back seating area is a good place to meet friends for a 'mellow' beer and chit-chat after dinner or work. All of the sports watching and local gossip takes place up towards the front. Friendly staff; no airheads allowed.","geo":{"lat":37.7627,"lon":-122.396,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":26053,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
