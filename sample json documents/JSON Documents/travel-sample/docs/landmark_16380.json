Graves range from plain to ornate and the site can be a tranquil place to walk amid the bustle of the city.  It was opened in 1840 and is still a working cemetery, although it was closed for a some time in the late twentieth century.  Can be nice, if morbid, for an afternoon stroll, especially as a route (and cycle route) between Old Brompton Road and Fulham Road.","geo":{"lat":51.485,"lon":-0.191,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16380,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Brompton_Cemetery_west_entrance_2.jpg"}
