It can be hard to distinguish between the two, and it's best not to try. An enjoyable afternoon's visit and a tribute to the weirdness of the world. An upstairs tea room serves complimentary tea and cookies. Free movie screenings hourly. This attraction is actually in the [[Los Angeles/Palms|Palms district]] of Los Angeles, although it has a Culver City address.","geo":{"lat":34.0256,"lon":-118.3954,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":7021,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
