We celebrated are wedding week at the Ames, my wife and I stayed at the Ames last year, the exact same weekend of the wedding just so we can have an idea how the weather would be so we could prepare our friend and family from Miami, FL. It has been such a marvelous experience working with Executive Assistant Julie Guerra at the Ames, she made all the arrangements and it was a breeze to coordinate everything with her and the hotel staff. In all honesty, they treated our 28 guests like family, there were no complaints just continued waves of compliments from our guests. The rooms are beautiful, clean and modern. The beds are so yummy, it made it hard to get out of bed some mornings. The location is perfect, take the shuttle at the airport to the blue line, and the blue line to state, the hotel is right across the street, you will get there in less than 10 mins. It's only a short drive from the airport, trust me I made several trips this past week. Faneuil Hall is right next to the hotel with plenty of shops and bars, shopping is just down the street, H&M, Macy's and several other stores are just a couple of blocks away. There are trolley tours that can take you around town. The blue/orange line is on state, and the blue/green government center line is behind the hotel. Since we needed to apply for our marriage license, city hall was just next to the hotel, less than a five minute walk. There are several banks nearby, and CVS if you need water or other essentials. The hotel is in a centralized location, and easily accessible via public transportation. The minute you get out of the car, the most cordial and helpful doormen, like Nick, Brandon, Ralique (I may be butchering the spelling of his name, sorry) and the other gentlemen who took wonderful care of us, greet you with a warm smile. The concierge Charles is phenomenal, he arranged transportation for our guest to the wedding location a few blocks away, and took care of any logistical concerns we had. My mom and my cousins are in love with him, he is just amazing. The front-desk staff, the amazing Rosy, Mary, Alison, Janelle, Frances, Kimberly, and Ben, they are always there to greet you with a smile, and always taking care of your every need. No reasonable request was every denied, we thank you for putting up with us the days leading to the wedding. Housekeeping is always on point the rooms are always spotless, and well-taken care, extra towels and toiletries are provided within minutes of request and always with a smile and pleasantries. We loved Deanna on the 14th floor; she took excellent care of us the whole week, even our dog Lenny is in love with her. Cecelia, I think she is head of housekeeping, she is an angel, she treated our dog like VIP, and the rest of housekeeping were always patient and kind. Downstairs at the Woodward, great service, excellent food, amazing selection of cocktails, beer and wine, Jake was our main server for the week, he and the manager Dana took excellent care of everyone all week. I donâ€™t think we ate breakfast or dinner anywhere else while in town. Everyone was sad to leave the Ames; no one wanted to go back home. We sincerely thank everyone at the Ames and the Woodward for their incredibly hospitality, they made our wedding week memorable and unforgettable.

It's in a great location and not too far to get to via the subway from the airport. The room was modern and nicely designed just like I like it. The only slight complain I would have is the tub in the bathroom was ridiculously high! You really have to step up to get into the bath tub. The decor in the rooms was lovely, very modern and sleek. Rooms were very clean and the bath products offered were nice. A plus is the free wi-fi service which I didn't have any problems using. Had breakfast in the hotel restaurant which was quite good. Staff was friendly.","ratings":{"Location":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":4.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Miss Edwina Pagac","date":"2012-09-24 01:54:53 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Arno Dare","Corine Jaskolski","Yoshiko Yundt"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Beautiful old building and useful location, with friendly and welcoming staff.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":true}
