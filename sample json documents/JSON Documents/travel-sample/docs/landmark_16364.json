Nevertheless, three themed gardens can be found here: a Spanish Garden, a Tudor Garden and an English Woodland, covering 1.5 acres of rooftop.  They were created in the 1930s by the owners of what was then the department store underneath.  You can gaze at a stream and its resident flamingos while looking over the rooftops of Kensington.  A restaurant and nightclub can also be found up here.","geo":{"lat":51.5012,"lon":-0.19208,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16364,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/London%2C_Kensington_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1971.jpg"}
