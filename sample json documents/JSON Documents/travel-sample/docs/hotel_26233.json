Everything was clean. Staff is great, very polite and willing to help. The weird thing is that it seems to have a few strange people actually living there. IÂ´m not sure about but IÂ´m guessing because these people were in bedrooms with different locks and they really act like theyÂ´re living there for a while. Anyway, it wasn't something that made me feel uncomfortable or anything. I really enjoyed. I would stay there again, for sure.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Mrs. Barry Kohler","date":"2012-02-19 19:39:48 +0300"},{"content":"I stayed in The Jane Hotel with a friend, as we didn't book in advance we stayed in the only rooms which were available, on the first night we shared a double room with a bunk bed, and on the second night we had two single rooms. Over all of stay was fantastic, the place has real character, the rooms are designed to look like sleeper cabins on the old orient express, the one downside of the hotel being that they are sized this was as well. But for a two night stay the limited space is fine. The bathrooms were shared, and even though this worried me a little at first it turned out to be no problem. We never had a problem getting in to use the facilities or take a shower. Now for some info on the shower, it was hands down one of the nicest I have ever used. All the rooms have ipod docks/speakers which was great, I loved being able to put on my music while getting ready to go out. The hotel has a restaurant and bar/club off the lobby, the restaurant which is French inspired and serves food all day, was very good, and I say that as a self proclaimed foodie. They have a good selection of reasonably priced cocktails as well, although the cucumber mint concoction should be avoided unless you are interested in drinking a cucumber. They make an excellent dry gin martini, and the watermelon mimosa was very good. The bar/club on the other side of the lobby, was fantastic. it seems to be a very popular destination at the moment, and they appear to be very controlled about how many people they will allow in, it is a big room decorated with a hodge podge of things, with lots of low velvet chairs and long couches. They seem to only allow as many people as there are places to sit into the bar, which is wonderful allowing for a relaxed intimate environment, the problem is that they have the music volume set just a bit to high, which makes conversation uncomfortable. Four of us met there for drinks after dinner, we had three rounds of very interesting and tasty cocktails (a bit pricey at $15 a pop) and ended up leaving to go to the restaurant for our last round as it would be more comfortable to talk in the there (plus the drinks are more affordable). The location was wonderful, walking distance to everything in the village and to midtown. We walked the couple of blocks to the High Line park as well, an experience not to be missed. Over all I would highly recommend The Jane Hotel to my friends, I don't think I would send my parents there but for well traveled and continental twenty somethings with a little extra money to spend it is a great weekend getaway.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Wilburn D'Amore","date":"2012-04-11 11:27:32 +0300"},{"content":"Where to start? The Jane is a great little hotel. The rooms are tiny, its like a train or ship cabin â€“ so be warned but you are in NYC so you shouldnâ€™t be spending too much time in them anyway. The room is equipped with A/C & a fan, TV, IPOD dock/alarm clock and safe. The mattress was a little on the thin side as its just a piece of foam but I managed to sleep well during my stay. The shared bathrooms were very clean and there was rarely a wait to use ether a shower or toilet â€“ although it was a little weird to learn that theyâ€™re shared by both male & female guests â€“ although you get used to this pretty quickly. They also provide Shampoo, Conditioner & Body wash in the showers. The location of the hotel was perfect â€“ very close to The High Line & Chelsea market with some great restaurants, bars and shops within walking distance. A few other reviews have mentioned issues with Taxiâ€™s â€“ I didnâ€™t have to wait for one at all during my 10 night stay â€“ a taxi into & around time sq was roughly $10 which I thought was pretty decent. The staff were great, although a couple of them had a little attitude. The one major issue that I did have was the elevator â€“ it hardly worked. After a day of walking around it was a little disappointing that the elevator wasnâ€™t working as I was on the 5th floor! Overall I had a great stay at the Jane and would recommend it to my friends and family if they are even in NYC.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Faye Swaniawski","date":"2014-03-26 11:34:02 +0300"},{"content":"My small cabin was my haven when I got stuck in New York because of the Icelandic volcano. I stayed in one of the single cabins; small but cosy and perfectly decorated. Many hooks to hang your clothes and practical space underneath the bed to accomodate your luggage. Every little detail was carefully thought through and I love that attention to detail in designing a hotel. I found the common bathrooms just as nice, with black and white tiled private shower cabins. The bed was comfortable but narrow; since its only for one person. The only negative aspect of my stay was that the window didnt block much of the traffic noises, so my sleep was a bit interrupted at times. But hey, its New York city right!? And they have rooms facing the other direction...","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Jaquelin Reinger","date":"2012-08-20 21:28:29 +0300"},{"content":"I stayed at The Jane and I had a wonderful time. My girlfriend and I were impressed by the clean and hospitable atmosphere. The posh bar downstairs made it a little embarassing as on the way in as we were often identified as too casual to make it in without a room key, but it was well worth it. I don't recommend a single room for two, as the bed is smaller than a hospital cot. Besides this if you aren't spending much time in your room the size of the area isn't bad. We had a really great stay.","ratings":{"Overall":5.0},"author":"Amelia Parker","date":"2012-08-18 05:40:37 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Luigi Reynolds","Jaylan Jewess","Grady Koepp","Julia Sipes","Cole Lockman","Fleta Emmerich","Arjun Moen","Charity Reinger","Elvis Wintheiser"],"vacancy":false,"description":"A stylish ‘green’ boutique hotel with beautiful rooms and suites, as well as meeting space, a fitness center, and on-site dining - Daffodil Restaurant.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
