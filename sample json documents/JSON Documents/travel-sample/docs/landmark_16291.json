It offers incomparable views over central London and up to 40 km (25 mi) away on a good day. Tickets are sold for specific times, so if visitors wish to go on the London Eye at a specific time, they are strongly advised to book in advance, particularly in the summer. On a busy day, you can easily spend 1-3 hr queuing just to buy a ticket. However, you can also purchase tickets in advance online. Then you can collect your tickets at the London Eye in a separate queue, which takes a few minutes or less.","geo":{"lat":51.5033,"lon":-0.1197,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16291,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null}
