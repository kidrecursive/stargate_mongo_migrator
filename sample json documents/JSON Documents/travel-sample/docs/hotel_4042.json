The pool was beautiful and our view from the balcony was great. We actually sat on our balcony one afternoon and watched whales for hours. How many places can you do that? However, when we arrived after about 12 hours in the air and another hour or so in pouring rain driving from the airport, we were informed that our \"Club Level\" lounge had just closed. Even though we paid full price for the Club Level that night, they did not even give us a free drink. A little disappointed there, but everything else was pretty nice.","ratings":{"Overall":3.0},"author":"Oda Gerlach","date":"2013-08-27 18:18:54 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Jevon Ullrich","Raegan Monahan","Dante Dooley","Nyah Cormier","Mollie Boyle DVM","Dr. Marvin Labadie","Hailie Rogahn","Frederick Haley PhD","Larue Heidenreich"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Fantastic little B&B with 3 rooms, all en-suite.
