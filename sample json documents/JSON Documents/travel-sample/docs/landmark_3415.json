The place is dark and busy and the noted cocktails fight for space on most tables. It's a chain, sure, but remains a consistent winner for great food and atmosphere.","geo":{"lat":34.064028,"lon":-118.398838,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":3415,"country":"United States","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"California"}
