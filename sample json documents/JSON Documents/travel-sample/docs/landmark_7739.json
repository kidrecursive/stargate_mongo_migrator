Highlights include a painted wrought-iron screen by the renowned local smith Robert Bakewell (1682&ndash;1751) and memorials to Beth of Hardwick and Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. Peregrine Falcons have nested on the tower for several years and volunteers are on hand with telescopes for viewing during spring and early summer.","geo":{"lat":52.924887,"lon":-1.477673,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":7739,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Derby","state":null}
