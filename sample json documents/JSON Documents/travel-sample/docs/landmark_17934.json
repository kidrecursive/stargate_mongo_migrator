It was established in 1951 to attract wintering waterfowl from adjacent farmland where their foraging activities were causing crop damage.  Today the refuge hosts the largest wintering populations of lesser Sandhill cranes and Ross’ geese along the Pacific Flyway. Each autumn more than 20,000 cranes and 60,000 arctic-nesting geese terminate their annual migrations from Alaska and Canada to make the Refuge home for six months.  The best chance of seeing the cranes is at sunrise and sunset - during the day the cranes mostly leave the refuge to feed in nearby fields.  Other birds that are found in the refuge include Swainson’s hawks, tri-colored blackbirds, marsh wrens, mallards, gadwall, cinnamon teal, and burrowing owls.  Most of the refuge is closed to the general public, but an auto tour loop is available that crosses several of the refuge's different habitats.","geo":{"lat":37.18208,"lon":-120.62608,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":17934,"country":"United States","city":"Merced","state":"California"}
