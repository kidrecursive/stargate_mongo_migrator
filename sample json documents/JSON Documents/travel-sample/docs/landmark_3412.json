Two lounges, one upstairs and one down, buffer the main dining room, which features a menu touting wonderful steak selections, as well as seafood and chicken. Side dishes demand top billing, too. The upstairs lounge is quite a scene, with a pianist crooning standards and bartenders whipping up endless orders of martinis for a showy crowd. The whole place operates at high speed, but the old school-meets-modern elegance ambiance, which is appealing in its own right, never overshadows the real star of the show – the food.","geo":{"lat":34.068836,"lon":-118.398849,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":3412,"country":"United States","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"California"}
