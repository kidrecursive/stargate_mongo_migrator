The castle is perched on cliffs overhanging the North Sea and provides stunning views. The best way to get there for adventurous folk is the mile-long hike from the town of Stonehaven. The hike is a narrow path along the cliffs that provides stunning views the entire way. Definitely a must-see.","geo":{"lat":56.946,"lon":-2.1979,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":28639,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Aberdeenshire","state":null}
