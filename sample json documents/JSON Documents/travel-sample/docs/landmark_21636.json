If you are lucky the soup of the day is the &quot;soupe au marron&quot;. There is a possibility to get a 3-course evening menu including entrée, plat and dessert. The home-made &quot;mousse au chocolat&quot; is really big. Also the bistro is generous on the sides: Usually one gets &quot;purée&quot;, rice and polenta. Inside the restaurant, the former tricot of the famous French football player Zinedine Zidane is on display. As the small place fills rapidly, reservation is recommended.","geo":{"lat":48.849775,"lon":2.291153,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":21636,"country":"France","city":"Paris-15E-Arrondissement","state":"Île-de-France"}
