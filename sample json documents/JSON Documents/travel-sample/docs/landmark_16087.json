Liverpool St is a safe area anyway but you cannot get safer than this for a late night meal, as at night you'll often see police from the nearby City of London police station. There are no toilets, however, so you need to use those at nearby Liverpool St Station.","geo":{"lat":51.5176,"lon":-0.08,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":16087,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null}
