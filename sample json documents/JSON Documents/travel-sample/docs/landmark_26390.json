Just keep in mind that they don't take reservations and are usually packed Thursday through Saturday nights with people queuing up. While they serve also US style sushi combinations like grilled stuff and with funny sauces on top, they have a great choice of traditional sushis and rolls with for example mackerel, salmon, tuna or yellowtail. The choices of sake are excellent.","geo":{"lat":34.423899,"lon":-119.705428,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":26390,"country":"United States","city":"Santa Barbara","state":"California"}
