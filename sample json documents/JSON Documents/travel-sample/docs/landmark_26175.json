There used to be an unusual observation deck on the ground floor with 4 big TV monitors, showing live views of the city transmitted from cameras at the top of the building. They now have a happy worker at the bottom that tells you anything and everything you want to know about San Francisco and has some great stories. Then he tells you that they no longer have the 4 big TVs and are building a restaurant where you can view the city from inside.","geo":{"lat":37.7952,"lon":-122.4028,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":26175,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
