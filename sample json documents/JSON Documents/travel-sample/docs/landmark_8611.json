The castle has been continuously in use for 1000 years and is in excellent condition. The audio tour, which costs £3.50 per headset, is extremely detailed and worth hiring, providing both location based and chronologically based commentary on the castle. Highlights include the Honours of Scotland (the Scottish Crown Jewels) and the ancient St Margaret's Chapel. There are also concerts on the castle esplanade (in the same stands as the Tattoo).","geo":{"lat":55.94854,"lon":-3.20042,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":8611,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Edinburgh","state":null}
