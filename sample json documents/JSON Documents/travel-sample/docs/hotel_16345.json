Great food, very clean, lots of loungers available all day, lots of shade, pleasant staff, no problem for hobie cat sailing every day. CONS - Beds. Unbelievable for a resort of this calibre. 2 unmatched single beds supplied. No upgrade possible as they told me that's all the entire resort had. You could'nt even put them side by side to form a double because they did not match and all you had for sheets were 2 sets of singles. Very old, worn out and uncomfortable. A lot of Europeans ie. smoke everywhere although there was an ample and pleasant smoke free area in the main buffet. The jacuzzi was cold. I never saw anyone use it. I'm suprised as a 4.5 star they would'nt spend a few extra dollars and heat the jacuzzi. Overall, a great value as long as you can handle the beds.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Business service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Hermann Harris","date":"2013-05-22 06:39:35 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Timmothy DuBuque","Joanne Towne","Laron Green","Don Sanford Jr.","Robin Schiller","Emilia Effertz","Tressie Koepp","Cesar Gibson"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Youth Hostel with late night bar.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
