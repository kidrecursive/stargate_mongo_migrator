Architecturally the building reflects the Vedantic philosophy that all roads lead to one God; hence the building has a mix of architectural styles like Edwardian, Moorish, Queen Anne, Colonial, and Oriental among others.  It has five different kinds of towers on the top including a Russian-style onion dome and a European-style castle turret.  The extraordinary temple was the first Hindu temple built in the West.","geo":{"lat":37.7981,"lon":-122.4342,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25692,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
