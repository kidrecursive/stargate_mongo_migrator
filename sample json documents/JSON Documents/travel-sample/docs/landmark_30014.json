This beach provides one of the most popular backdrops for portrait pictures and is the focus of most photographers who visit Tenby, providing them with some of the most dramatic sunrises set parallel to a quaint pastel coloured harbour filled with working trawlers. Goscar Rock sits in the centre of this mile long beach providing hours of fun for young and old to sift through the rock pools, shelter from the winds and, for those who dare, a small climbing adventure (although not advised for any novice climber).","geo":{"lat":51.67692,"lon":-4.70176,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":30014,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Tenby","state":null}
