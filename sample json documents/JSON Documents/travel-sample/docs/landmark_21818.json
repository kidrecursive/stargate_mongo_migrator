It is a very elegant centre of green in the middle of cosmopolitan Paris. Make sure you check out the statues, entrance rotunda and the surrounding mansions. Thanks to Haussmann himself this precious slice of parkland was reserved for the enjoyment and leisure of the people of Paris. It is unusual in France due to its casual, informal &quot;English&quot; style planning, and is a contrast to other Parisian parks such as the classically laid out and formal Luxemburg Gardens and the Tuileries. Randomly placed throughout the park are scaled-down architectural replicas including an Egyptian pyramid, Dutch windmill, and a Chinese fort. Free Wi-Fi in the park.","geo":{"lat":48.87937,"lon":2.30888,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":21818,"country":"France","city":"Paris-8E-Arrondissement","state":"ÃŽle-de-France"}
