Even if you're not planning on doing any shopping, it's worth coming here just to ''see'' the place. Horton Plaza contains nearly 200 stores and restaurants, including a couple of department stores, a food court on the 4th floor, and entertainment options such as a movie theater. From March to October, a '''farmer's market''' takes place every Thursday from 11AM-3PM on the square just north of the mall.","geo":{"lat":32.71392,"lon":-117.16237,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"buy","type":"landmark","id":25136,"country":"United States","city":"San Diego","state":"California"}
