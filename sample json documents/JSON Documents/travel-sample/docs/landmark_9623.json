The paved trail is entirely car-free thanks to underpasses beneath each cross-street. About two miles from the bay, you can optionally go to Coyote Hills for a good view. From there, you can proceed south to the Don Edwards Wildlife refuge, and then west to the bike lane over the Dumbarton Bridge. Starting from the easternmost point on the trail (at the Niles Staging Area on Old Canyon Road) means that you will generally go downwind last when you are most tired.","geo":{"lat":37.57946,"lon":-121.96602,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":9623,"country":"United States","city":"Fremont","state":"California"}
