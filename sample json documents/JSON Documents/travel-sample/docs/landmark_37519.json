One of the larger and more successful missions in the 18th century, it is the only mission with a three-aisled church. The resting place of Father Estevan Tapis, who led the mission system from 1803 to 1812, and later served as the mission's choir director, solidifying Bautista's reputation as the &quot;Mission of Music&quot;. During secularization, the mission housed survivors of the Donner Party, and contains some of their artifacts to this day. Major restorations took place in 1884, 1949, and 2010. Alfred Hitchcock fans will likely recognize the mission from the climatic scene of the classic film ''Vertigo''; unfortunately, the bell tower in the movie was a fake and looks nothing like the real one, but the rest of the mission scenes were indeed shot here.  Contains furnishings from the mid-19th century, including ca. 1816 altar statues and screens.","geo":{"lat":36.845319,"lon":-121.536151,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":37519,"country":"United States","city":"Watsonville","state":"California"}
