Older dams can be seen at low water in the hole, several parts of old millstones were found in the area and are now near the door. The Norse Mill has been restored and is working again. Water from the Loch na Muilne is passed through a channel to the mill drives the milling machinery and then flows into the sea. The horizontal blades of the wheel are located in the lower chamber. Thanks to its location on the sheltered bay the farmers could bring their grain by boat to the mill. The lobster pond nearby has also been restored. It was built in the mid-1800s. In it, the fishermen were able to keep their catch alive until the market offered good prices.","geo":{"lat":58.23109,"lon":-6.82732,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":38439,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Na h-Eileanan an Iar","state":null}
