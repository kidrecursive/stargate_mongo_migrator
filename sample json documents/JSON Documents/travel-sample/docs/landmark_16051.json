The bridge opens several times each day to permit ships to pass through – timings are dependent on demand, and are not regularly scheduled. When Tower Bridge was built, the area to the west of it was a bustling port – necessitating a bridge that could permit tall boats to pass. Now the South Bank area sits to its west, and the regenerated Butler's Wharf area of shops, reasonably-priced riverside restaurants and the London Design Museum lie to its east. For a small charge you can get the lift to the top level of the bridge and admire the view: this includes a visit to a museum dedicated to the bridge's history and engineering, and photographic exhibitions along the Walkways between the towers.","geo":{"lat":51.5058,"lon":-0.0752,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16051,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Greater London","state":null}
