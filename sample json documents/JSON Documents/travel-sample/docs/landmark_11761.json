Crowds can be huge, so arrive prior to gates opening if you want a good vantage point. Most people bring a picnic dinner, a drink (wine or beer allowed, no spirits), blanket, pillow (or low chair) and jacket.  A DJ plays music prior to the showing to create a fun outdoor atmosphere. Tickets (including parking) often sell out and should therefore be purchased in advance through the Cinespia web site.","geo":{"lat":34.089097,"lon":-118.318775,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":11761,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
