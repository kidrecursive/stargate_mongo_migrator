Uncomplicated, but no less innovative and tasty salads, fish, meats, sandwiches and assorted entrees form an inviting menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Ahi Three Ways (Seared Ahi with Pepper Corn, Crepe Wrapped Ahi, Ahi Tartar, Mixed Greens and a Warm Ponzu Sauce), Black & White Salmon, Breakfast Quesadilla, Applewood Smoked Bacon Sandwich and Three Cheese Ravioli are menu standouts. Prepare for an excellent bread assortment. The room is bright, airy and warm, presenting a taste of Americana with old farm utensils and folk art hanging on the muted-colored walls. Location equals waiting list for Saturday-Sunday brunch. But it's worth the wait. Most weeknights a reservation can be avoided. But this is Beverly Hills, so... Amazing brownies.","geo":{"lat":34.070613,"lon":-118.402813,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":3396,"country":"United States","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"California"}
