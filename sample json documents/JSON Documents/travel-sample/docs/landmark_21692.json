If you want to see everything in the Louvre, plan ''at least'' two full days. However, it is better to pick and choose, as the collection was assembled with an eye to completeness rather than quality.","geo":{"lat":48.86106,"lon":2.33562,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":21692,"country":"France","city":"Paris","state":"Île-de-France"}
