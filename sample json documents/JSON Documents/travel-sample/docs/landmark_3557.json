It has an ornate entrance on the Temple Row side, and a less impressive one from Colmore Row and a clock with carillion. There is a mixture of all kinds of shops, all pleasantly fitting within the late 19th-century theme with their decorations.","geo":{"lat":52.48186,"lon":-1.89719,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"buy","type":"landmark","id":3557,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Birmingham","state":null}
