Received no correspondence or verification regarding my reservation or cancellation because the hotel entered an incorrect email address, mailing address and spelled my name wrong in their system. Not surprising because I was put on hold numerous times during my calls regarding my original reservation and cancellation. Obvious confusion resulted in my reservation and cancellation and my reservation was never cancelled. Hotel charged me a $156 no-show charge for a reservation I had cancelled. Hotel management claims their system is failproof. They refuse to refund the no-show charge; however, they offered me a free night's stay to compensate me for my trouble. Why would the hotel offer me a free night's stay rather than refund the no-show charge that they should not have charged me? Obviously they know a mistake on their part was possible if offering some compensation. Hotel has simply responded through my Better Business Bureau complaint that they will not refund the no-show charge, but will provide a free night's stay to me. They will get away with this again, even if a small claims court awards me the reimbursement of the no-show charge. I recommend not staying here, not necessarily because of their mistake (mistakes happen) but because of the unscrupulous business practices of their management and their unwillingness to admit and correct their error. We stayed at a MUCH nicer hotel (I have stayed at the Quality Inn Seattle Center on two occassions before this incident), Pioneer Square Best Western Hotel for just a little bit more money. The hotel was high class, quiet, room and staff were great and the location was within walking distance of Safeco Field, Waterfront, downtown, many restaurants, coffee shops, Fish Market etc.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Location":2.0,"Rooms":2.0},"author":"Erica Moen","date":"2013-08-26 20:03:54 +0300"},{"content":"My family of four (including 7 & 9 year old boys) stayed at this downtown Seattle hotel for two (2) nights before an Alaskan cruise. It was one of the less expensive hotels in the area and I was not expecting luxury, but my overall stay was disappointing. On the good side, it is in a safe area just a few blocks from the Space Needle and surrounding attractions and Pike's Market and the waterfront are walkable (although a little bit of a hike). However, the rooms and lobby are tired (the entire building really), the breakfast area overcrowded and it is serviced by a single, small, slow elevator. The advertised free shuttle to the dock was instead $6.00 per person and contracted out to a van service and the high speed internet was also down. The front desk staff was adequate, but I could have accomplished the same goals for less (with a better breakfast) at the adjoining Travelodge. At best, this is a 1-2 night hotel when waiting to go on a cruise (which about half of the guests were). For that purpose, it's fine. However, if you are visiting Seattle as your destination, I would look elsewhere.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":2.0,"Check in / front desk":2.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":2.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Mrs. Kristin Cruickshank","date":"2013-12-12 19:10:21 +0300"},{"content":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a room with a jacuzzi in Seattle and this one was in our price range so I called them to book a room. The girl at the front desk told me in a very [----] and curt way that there was no rooms available for the dates I wanted, then hung up. I looked at the website and there were tons of rooms so I called back and was able to book a room for the exact same dates I said the first time with no trouble?!?!?! Should have been my first clue.... Then when we get there she wouldn't process my Canadian debit card at the front desk and told me I needed to find an atm. She told me I could go up the street to a gas station. We did, but then the next day realized that there was an atm that worked fine for our card right in the lobby of the hotel?!?!!? THE WORST PART - At some point in the middle of the night, someone opened our room door. It caught on the chain but it opened. I woke up but wasn't sure if I was imagining it or what, so I just stayed awake all night after that. The next day we went down to breakfast and then tried to come back, and our key cards wouldn't work. We went to front desk and it turns out that when we paid the day before no one had bothered to check us in fully in the computer, so in the middle of the night the front desk guy gave our room to one of his friends.... Then he deactivated our keys because we weren't checked in?!?!? This hotel is disorganized and has terrible service. Also, the location isn't that great, but you can walk to downtown and its cheap. The jacuzzi was fun tho, I just don't recommend using bubble bath cause you can't control those bubbles with the jets on!","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Check in / front desk":1.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":2.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Marcella Spencer","date":"2015-10-07 00:07:53 +0300"},{"content":"Desk clerks were not helpful as they should of been in getting the type of room we had booked 4 month's in advance.The maids and baggage handlers were very courteous and helpful.Ricky was the only desk clerk who seemed to know what he was doing.The pool was closed the three nights we were there with promises that it would open very soon.Double room which we did not book was much nicer than the two queen bed room we did book.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3.0,"Check in / front desk":2.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Bell Cummerata","date":"2014-11-07 22:01:04 +0300"},{"content":"Attending a conference in Seattle recently, I am so glad I stayed at the Sheraton. It is readily apparent that this facility was carefully thought through. Everything is convenient and the service is top-flight. The location is close to everything, too--shopping, restaurants, the convention center, tourist attractions, and so much more. The restaurant is quite nice and the lounge area is tasteful and relaxed. The room was so clean and quiet plus the linens were elegant as so comfortable. I will definitely stay at Sheraton again--and am looking forward to it!!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Jeffry Berge","date":"2013-08-16 12:22:44 +0300"},{"content":"This was the perfect location for my meeting at the Seattle convention center. The room was nice and reasonably quiet. However there were 2 problems that I encountered: 1) The gym was exceptionally crowded each time I went. There were always lines for equipment and some items were out of service. 2) The stairwells were filthy, though one did get cleaned when I complained. I was surprised as Seattle seems to encourage people to be green, use stairs, compost, etc. The stairwells had many cigarette butts, beer bottles, candy, chips, razor blades with white powder, and sticky substances which made the walk unpleasant.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Ally West","date":"2014-04-10 13:53:21 +0300"},{"content":"Please see my previous review for more details... To summarize: The Pike Tower is the older side. I had a priceline deal, and when asked to go to the newer Union Tower (like other priceliners have received when asked), the gentlemen said that it was a $20/night upgrade. Oh well. The only parking onsite is valet, charging $44/night. There are a couple of public parking sites within a half block of the hotel for $26-30 per night, with in/out privileges. I usually park next to the cheese cake factory, which is across the street from the back entrance to the hotel. We stayed in an --08 room, which is literally across from the elevator and the ice machine. Not too loud though, but the door for the ice machine swings back pretty loud. Save yourself a room cleaning, and receive a $5 voucher for food in the hotel. No free wi-fi in the room, but plenty of free terminals in the lobby and free wi fi. The rooms are decent, nothing to complain about. Good water pressure for the showers. Overall, a great place to stay in a very central location (pike place 5 minutes away, shopping malls 3 minutes away).","ratings":{"Overall":4.0},"author":"Miss Gerson Grady","date":"2012-09-19 23:58:19 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Crystal Gislason","Clifton Weber","Khalid Predovic","Torey Ullrich","Mrs. Paxton Konopelski","Lonie Jakubowski"],"vacancy":false,"description":"A luxury Bed and Breakfast located on Topanga Canyon Boulevard.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":false,"free_parking":false}
