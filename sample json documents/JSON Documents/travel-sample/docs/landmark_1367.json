However, the Church of England decided that the house was too large and it was let to Bernard and Charlotte Shaw from 1906. They bought it outright in 1920. The Shaws changed very little inside the house but they installed a generator so that electricity could be provided and built a large garage and greenhouse. In the quintessentially English garden is the hut where Shaw wrote many plays. Inside the house the clothes in Shaw's wardrobe, the typewriter, glasses and dictionary in his study and the collection of hats in the hall, as well as the 1938 Oscar for Pygmalion, give you the sense that he has just left the room.","geo":{"lat":51.836215,"lon":-0.26844,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":1367,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Hertfordshire","state":null}
