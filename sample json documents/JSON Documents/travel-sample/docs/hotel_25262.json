I'm so glad we decided to stay at the Biltmore in one of their Villa Suites! Not only was the pool amazing, there was so much room in our Villa that we never had to leave the hotel! Also, a HUGE thank you to Curtis who took care of getting us to our room along with any other requests we had! The next time we need to \"get away\" we'll definitely look to the Biltmore!!!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Location":3.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"D'angelo Reynolds III","date":"2015-12-10 21:30:45 +0300"},{"content":"Diamond award stay. Booked standard double queen room and was upgraded to Ocatilla. Nice big room with big bathroom, pool view, so far we are impressed. Saturday afternoon pool was PACKED, but we were still able to find seats at the bar and lounges. No problem with towels. Bar menu was good, nice Greek salad, drinks were reasonably priced for a resort. Service at the bar was fine, a chef came out and did a salsa demonstration and gave samples to all who wanted. It was part of the Biltmore's 80th birthday celebration. So far so good..... right? .....not. Two teens we brought were VERY unimpressed witht he water slide and complained of bordom for the entire stay. The dive in movie that was promised and the kids were looking forward to didn't happen. As happy hour rolled around we went to use our key to get into the executive lounge (that is supposed to come with the Ocatilla upgrade) and lo and behold, it won't work. So I make a call to the front desk and was told since we recieved the room upgrade we were not entitled to the executive lounge too. BS! I went to the front desk and had a chat with the supervisor and was given new keys and access to the lounge. We had a glass or two of wine and a few snacks (all accurately described above) and headed back to the pool area for a light dinner. We didn't feel like getting gussied up for the fancy restaurant. Apparently we showed up about 20 minutes before closing time (8PM on a Saturday night!) and the waiter took 15 minutes in an almost empty place (only one other table occupied) to even come offer drinks. We ordered some chicken wings and salads and sandwiches which took another 25 minutes to arrive at our table. The wings were completely burnt to a crisp. My daughter and her boyfriend, both veteran fine dining establishment employees, were agast at both the quality of the food and the service. After a complaint to the server, the wings were taken off the bill, but too little too late. We were offered free dessert too but know better about ordering more food from a kitchen after complaining. You never know what you are going to get Forest. The resort is absolutely beautiful, the grounds, the views, the art and the history are impressive to us as 17 year Arizona residents. Don't waste your money staying or dining there. Maybe it was a skeleton summer crew in Phoenix and the service may be better there in the \"season\". I'll never go back. If you want to see the place and have a drink at Wrights bar, walk about the property for a few hours, you can get a feel for the place it used to be. Its nothing like that anymore. Very very dissappointing after all the hype.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Keon Labadie","date":"2015-09-19 16:47:08 +0300"},{"content":"I just spent three days there on a business trip. I was disappointed. The hotel sells membership to the locals, so the main pool/spa becomes insanely crowded on the weekend. Because the pool was packed with people who weren't even staying at the hotel, I really resented the 28 dollar resort fee. The pool felt more like a public park than a resort. There were screaming kids everywhere, and their obese moms drinking pina coladas. It was Ohio in the desert. Just an awful scene. That said, the buildings are very pretty. Frank Lloyd Wright did not design it, but one of his students did, and it is a very pleasant imitation. As others have said here, it is getting a little worn. So, if you are looking for a family vacation, this might be a good hotel. I'd skip it if you are on business or looking for a relaxing resort experience.","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":2.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":3.0},"author":"Wyman VonRueden","date":"2012-03-12 10:49:53 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. Our purpose was to \"get away\" and relax. Our experience (first at this hotel) was just that. Our room was perfect. It was spacious and clean. It seemed as though it was brand new. The bed was incredible and the extra things throughout the room were nice: little cactus on shelf, the sparkling white robe and slippers, the bath salts and candles, the big TV...I could continue. We happened to run into a Mr. Jeremy Beck, who was the director of the housekeeping crew and let him know how happy we were. Our dining experience in the Write restaurant was wonderful and fun. We got a kick out of the water/bread gentleman named Martin. He was charming and made us smile with his \"Good evening\" both nights we were there. We also asked him to take our picture and he did so and was just super cute about it. A charming man. The whole food experience was also something to talk about. We ate pork chops and then the steak with mushrooms. Superb. I especially loved the tomato salad and my sweetheart loved the onion soup. I could go on and on. The bottom line is our stay at the Biltmore, in the Occotillo section of the hotel, was terrific. Everyone was very helpful, our room was perfect, the pool was refreshing and the service was top of the line. Thank you. We will return.

Not to mention, the employees eye-$@!#% my girlfriend the entire time. The guy told me that I had to buy them at the gift shop if I needed them. The food at the restaurant was good, but way overpriced.... just like everything else there. The location is horrible, especially if you can't rent a car. It cost me $100 just to get into Tempe and back, so I would not recommend this place if you plan on leaving the hotel campus. The thing that really made me angry was seeing the bill at the end of our trip. One thing that they don't disclose to you before you get a room is that there is a $28 room fee (plus $4 in taxes) for each day you stay there to cover the hotel amenities. For a 4 night stay, I paid $128 for room fees! Ridiculous!!! Trust me, the hotel is very pretty, but definitely not worth the cost and the hype. DO NOT stay here!","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":1.0,"Location":1.0,"Rooms":3.0},"author":"Norris Terry","date":"2013-11-06 08:33:05 +0300"},{"content":"...You Don't Want to Have THE ABSOLUTE BEST TIME of Your Life!! ;) My fiance and I just spent 4 nights at the luxurious Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa in Phoenix, AZ. We stayed in the brand new Ocotillo rooms in the Arizona Wing - and wow - the beds were amazing! I've never slept so good in my life!! Make sure you get a great view of the pool - you won't regret it! The staff was amazing - and the service was A++! My only complaint was that I couldn't stay longer!! (my vacation ended too soon!!) I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a romantic and relaxing vacation spot. PS: The hotel is only a few blocks from terrific shopping and dining! If you get the chance, check out True Food at the Biltmore Shops down the street.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Ruby Hills","date":"2014-05-29 18:27:17 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Aracely Vandervort","Brianne Ward"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Free hot breakfast and internet.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
