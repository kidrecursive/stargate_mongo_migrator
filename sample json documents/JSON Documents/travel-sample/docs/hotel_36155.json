Our apartment (named for Titian) was two floors with a very large living room with windows that opened to the canal and a great dining area. The couches in the room converted into beds for my two children, while upstairs was another bedroom and the bathroom. The included kitchen area made making snacks or little meals simple and easy, and the street that the Palazzo is located on is filled with great little restaurants, shops, and the occasional gondolier. The staff and owners of the Palazzo Odoni were very friendly and helpful as well. All in all a terrific place to stay -- we will come back again when we are in Venice.
