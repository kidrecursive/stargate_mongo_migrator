The neighbourhood is slightly seedy but there are good eating and drinking places close by. The rooftop terrace is a real bonus and allows you to meet other guests and have a glass of wine whilst enjoying excellent views over Seattle. The rooms are a good size and spotless, but lack air conditioning (an issue whilst we were in Seattle because it was really hot) and if you left the window open then the close proximity of other rooms across the courtyard meant that there was quite a lot of noise. All the reception staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and we really enjoyed our stay despite the minor drawbacks.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Fanny Sauer","date":"2012-10-29 21:53:27 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Cory Vandervort","Maximilian Bosco"],"vacancy":true,"description":"22 rooms","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
