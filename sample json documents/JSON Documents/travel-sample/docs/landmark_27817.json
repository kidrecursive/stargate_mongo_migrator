Most nights of the week you can get selected foodstuffs for cheap, such as a burger with a salad for $5. Good wine with good prices and live music, too. Sit inside or outside - outside is cool with firepits. Lots of locals hangout here.","geo":{"lat":38.293155,"lon":-122.474433,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":27817,"country":"United States","city":"Sonoma","state":"California"}
