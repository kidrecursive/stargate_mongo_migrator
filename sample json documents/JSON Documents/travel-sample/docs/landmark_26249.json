Wonderful (expensive) cocktails based on 100-year old recipes. Not the cheapest place in town, but affordable and the quality of the food is an excellent value. A pretty, white-tablecloth setting and excellent service make this a lovely lunch spot. Avoid weekend evenings before 8PM, when crowds from the nearby theater district can mean a wait. And they now serve absinthe.","geo":{"lat":37.777,"lon":-122.4228,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":26249,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
