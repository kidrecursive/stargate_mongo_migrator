Â£30 per person for three courses including wine","content":"Traditional, hearty English food done very well, in a beautiful and well-preserved mediaeval building with sheltered views of the 13th-century Church of St Thomas. Lots of game and poultry on the menu, exquisite wine selection, impeccable service and gorgeous food, for a very decent price. In World War II, the tiny &quot;Horsebox&quot; bar downstairs was used by Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower to plan the D-Day offensive. This place positively crawls with history, and dinner here is classy, interesting, and completely unpretentious.","geo":{"lat":51.068789,"lon":-1.796329,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":24885,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Salisbury","state":null}
