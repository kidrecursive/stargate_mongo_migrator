Contains the '''Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery''' (see below), including a reconstruction of Mackintosh's house. The exterior of the main building is fine in its own right; the current main University building is neo-Gothic and dates from 1870, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott (the man who also designed London's St Pancras railway station). The main building has an interesting visitor's centre (open all year round) which is free and sits atop a drumlin with commanding views over Kelvingrove Park and the western fringes of the city.","geo":{"lat":55.87273,"lon":-4.28797,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":10094,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Glasgow","state":null}
