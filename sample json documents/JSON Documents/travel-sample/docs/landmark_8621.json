This is a good place to go if you want to sample whisky, as they have a very large selection (200+?) at a fairly reasonable price. Older whiskys tend to cost more and the rarest on offer can cost up to £50.00 per measure! The atmosphere is less pub-like than some might like as it tends to be fairly quiet.","geo":{"lat":55.94876,"lon":-3.19586,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":8621,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Edinburgh","state":null}
