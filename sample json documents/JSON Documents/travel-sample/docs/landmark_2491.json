This building has been restored, and contains a replica of a stone containing both Viking runes and Celtic designs. The stone commemorates the Christian burial of a Viking princess - Thorgeth, daughter of Steinar. The orioginal stone is kept in Edinburgh. In the graveyard here is the grave of Compton MacKenzie, who took the idea for the story &quot;Whisky Galore&quot; from the sinking of &quot;The Politician&quot; during World War II. It is thought that Mackenzie used the idea and possibly some of the drafted text about which a local school teacher had asked him his opinion.","geo":{"lat":57.0394,"lon":-7.4342,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":2491,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Eoligarry","state":null}
