The factory had produced a number of storied Austin and Morris vehicles before becoming the hub for the Rover brand production, as it replaced the former two. In the next chapter of its history, the MG brand in turn was revived and replaced Rover as the fate of the company changed. As MG is not present in most Western countries, many visitors may be unaware that the company is still trading and assembling a new generation of vehicles at the Longbridge plant.&lt;br&gt;The site tours include not only the factory, but also the MG Museum, a preserved office of Lord Austin, the Technical Centre where new MGs are developed and the Sales Centre, where one can get acquainted with the current MG lineup and even have a test drive (should be pre-arranged when booking the tour).|hours=Tours start 1.00pm every Thursday and last 2 hours|price=£5 per person|phone=+44 121 251 6533/4|email=info@mg-salescentre.co.uk|url=http://mg.co.uk/factory-tours/|lat=52.3895 | long=-1.9891|directions=There is not much in the way of public transportation options, and the area is not quite walkable.
