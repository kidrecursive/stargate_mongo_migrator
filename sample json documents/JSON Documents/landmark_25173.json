The beach is closed Dec 15-May 15 during breeding season, but you can still observe the seals from a safe distance. This beach used to be the children's beach, and there is an ongoing dispute between animal rights supporters and others who disagree about who should own the beach. Depending on the current turn of events, swimming may or may not be permitted. Occasionally, the seals vanish, but move a few hundred feet to the right, close to the cove itself.","geo":{"lat":32.84757,"lon":-117.27846,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25173,"country":"United States","city":"San Diego","state":"California"}
