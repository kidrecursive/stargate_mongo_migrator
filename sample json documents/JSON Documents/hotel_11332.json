It is an excellent hotel. The staff are very friendly, especially in the restaurant which serves an amazing selection of reasonably priced local dishes. The hotel is ideally situated for walking to various attractions, and also had a bookable minibus to get to the \"hop-on/hop-off\" tour bus. The rooms were excellent and quiet, despite being near a busy road. We will definitely stay there again when we are next in Singapore.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Antonio Hodkiewicz","date":"2014-03-17 12:20:58 +0300"},{"content":"More than adequate for a stop over after a week of diving.

Friendly and helpful staff. Good placement of the hotel: you can walk to many city attractions from here on foot and also have all 4 MRT lines access within 10-15 minutes of walk. Neat room with good noise-isolation, free Internet and comfortable bed. Bonuses like free city tour and discount lottery during check-in made our experience even better.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Stan Upton","date":"2014-01-22 16:39:20 +0300"},{"content":"For a short stopover in Singapore this was good value for money.
