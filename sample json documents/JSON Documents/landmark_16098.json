In 1819, viceroy Mehemet Ali presented Cleopatra's Needle to the British, commemorating military victories in Egypt, but it remained in Alexandria until 1877 when transportation was arranged to bring it to London.  On the voyage, the ship capsized in a storm, killing six crewmembers.  Cleopatra's Needle was thought to be lost, but Spanish trawlers found it afloat a few days later, and after some repairs, it arrived in London on 21 Jan 1878. The obelisk is flanked by two faux-sphinxes, which show the effects of bombings of London during World War II.  Today, Cleopatra's Needle shows some wear from exposure to London's damp weather.","geo":{"lat":51.5085,"lon":-0.1203,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16098,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null}
