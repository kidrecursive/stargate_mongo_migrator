Attend a church service for free and enjoy some of the finest choral music in London from the choir. Evensong at 4PM or 5PM, depending on time of year, is an especially good bet. The Abbey is the traditional scene for the Coronation of British monarchs and the burial place of many past kings and queens. | image=Westminster Abbey West Door.jpg","geo":{"lat":51.4994,"lon":-0.1274,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16474,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Deans Yd","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Westminster_Abbey_West_Door.jpg"}
