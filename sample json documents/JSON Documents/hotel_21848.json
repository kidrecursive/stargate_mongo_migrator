I love Makena. Love it. It's everything I think Hawaii should be. The Makena Golf Resort is the last resort on the south side of the island. It's quiet and less crowded compared to the west side of the island. The resort has a charming old school Hawaiian feel to it. The views from the rooms were exquisite. The pool was a little small but the resort was not packed so it wasn't a problem. If the resort had been at full capacity I think it would have been an issue. The beach right in front of the resort is gorgeous! We so enjoyed it, great snorkeling, lots of turtles and not overly crowded. The rooms were prefect for us. They were not updated, but they were clean, comfortable and had a nice feel. I would definitely go back. My disclaimer: We booked our rooms on priceline for a discounted rate. If I had paid full price, I'm not sure my review would be so glowing. But for the price it was wonderful!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Mr. Darryl O'Reilly","date":"2012-11-02 03:36:14 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Dr. Murphy Maggio","Sage Denesik","Armand Schimmel","Timothy Ritchie","Boyd Dibbert","Tierra Casper","Dorian Conn","Bria Mann","Halle Jenkins"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Near the Champs Elysées and Faubourg Saint-Honoré, very close to the Arc-de-Triomphe.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":true}
