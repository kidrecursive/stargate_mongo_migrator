However, I, my wife and my two years old son had a great time at Natural Park. We had a lot of fun and met a lot of people. Food was great, but I think they could have more variety. For example fresh fruit juices were missing.Overall, It was a great place and I do recommend natural Park to my friends","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Check in / front desk":-1.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":-1.0},"author":"Kelly Stokes","date":"2014-06-08 11:38:59 +0300"},{"content":"paradise       one of the \"patios\" of rooms","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":-1.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":-1.0},"author":"Sarina Schuster","date":"2014-02-04 09:33:36 +0300"}],"public_likes":[],"vacancy":false,"description":"The staff is very gentle and helpful. It is clean, and the rooms are all right, they are a bit small, have fridge, a small TV, but no table. The hotel is not nice, but OK. The breakfast is uninteresting, except the coffee, which is awful! But, the tea and the juice are good. It is close to many pubs, caf√©s and shops. Good place to stay, but lots of traffic.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":true}
