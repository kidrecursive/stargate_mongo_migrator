This is a northern outpost of [[Yorkshire]]'s ''Samuel Smiths'' Brewery, and serves only in-house drinks - no branded beers at all, and even the cola and lemonade are own-brand. You won't mind missing out on Guinness or Stella when you see the prices though - generally less than £2 a pint which is almost unheard of in Edinburgh. Sunny (or even non-rainy) weekends bring the crowds, and service sometimes suffers as a result. Tables outside for al-fresco drinking but food service is indoors-only.","geo":{"lat":55.97976,"lon":-3.30005,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":8708,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Edinburgh","state":null}
