The statue was removed amid revolutionary fervor in 1792 and replaced in 1806 with the ''Colonne de la Grande Armée''. This was modelled on Trajan's column in [[Rome]] and decorated with Napoleon's military exploits. The present column is a replica, however, as the original was pulled down during the 1871 Paris Commune. Place Vendôme represents the best of well-heeled Paris, being home to an abundance of exclusive boutiques, jewellers and fashion labels—Cartier, Boucheron, Trussardi, van Cleef & Arpels—several banks, the French Ministry of Justice, and the Ritz Hotel.","geo":{"lat":48.86746,"lon":2.32947,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":21683,"country":"France","city":"Paris","state":"Île-de-France","image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/PlaceVendome.JPG"}
