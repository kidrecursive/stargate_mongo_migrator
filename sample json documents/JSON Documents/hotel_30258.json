I found it perfect. I called 10 days before my arrival and got the exact room I'd hoped to get. I was upstairs on the corner. I had two windows, one faced the pool the other faced the river. I was in Oak Manor near the bridge that is closest to the main facility. One night on the way back from Magic Kingdom we had just missed the bus to the Riverside resort, so we decided to take the bus to French Quarter and walk the path over. We weren't halfway there when a security guy picked us up in his golf cart and dropped us at the bridge that goes straight to our building. This trip was during the holiday season and the resort was decorated beautifully. I would definitely stay at this resort again. I highly recommend it to families. The food court was great. The prices were high, but you expect that at Disney. Although we did order a pizza at the food court to take back to the room and it only cost about 15.00. And that fed us all. We flew so we were sort of at the mercy of Disney prices as we didn't have a car to go off property. I would definitely recommend having a car if at all possible. We had a fridge in the room so if I'd had a car I could have gone to Walmart for lunch meat. But whatever, it was fun. The hotel was great. Again, I would recommend this resort.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Trisha Roberts DDS","date":"2013-03-27 18:42:32 +0300"},{"content":"There are two types of themed residential areas in this resort. The â€œAlligator bayou.â€� area has smaller accommodation blocks and an informal feel and atmosphere. The other region (called Magnolia Bend) is an impressive and formal deep south, old grand mansion, look and feel area. There is a (0.9 mile) walkway / cycle path which forms a loop around and across the Sassagoula river which runs through the center of the resort. The pathway has a link to through to the French Quarter resort. The path affords great views of the resort as you wander, jog or cycle around it. Depending on which accommodation you get you may get very familiar with the walkway as you trail back and forward to the food court. Aside from the theming the rooms are identical. The Alligator bayou rooms have (fake) log bed frames which are really easy to stub your toes on. (yep I speak from experience there.) The rooms are slightly bigger than an All Star Resort room and have a refrigerator and coffee making facilities. Other than that they are the same basic layout with the door at the front and the bathroom (with no window) at the rear. The room can be a little dark if the lights are switched off. (Why would you be in the room during the day anyway?) The air conditioning is a through the wall unit rather than a central type and it can be a bit noisy if you leave it on. (Itâ€™s Florida, you will probably leave it on.) There are some good swimming pools with the relaxed â€œOlâ€™ Man Islandâ€� pool having a water slide. All Pools at Disney are heated so you can swim all year round. Food court. The resorts reception, bars shop and restaurants are located in the â€œSassagoula Steamboat Companyâ€� building. There is service restaurant (Boatwrightâ€™s) and a general dining area (Riverside Mill) with a reasonable choice of food. Both are nicely themed. There is also a bar which serves snack food in the main building and a bar poolside on Olâ€™ Man Island. The shop has a limited choice of essential items and the usual large choice of Disney items. This is a nice calm and relaxed resort. It is a more grown up resort than All Star for not excessively more money. The grounds and general ambiance is superb and this makes the resort feel like it is a higher standard than the moderate grade it is afforded. I would not recommend this as a first choice for families with young children as it isnâ€™t quite as â€œDisneyfiedâ€� as other resorts. If you want a similar standard that is a little more kid entertaining go next door to French Quarter.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Mary Conroy","date":"2014-02-20 13:21:42 +0300"},{"content":"This is the second time that we have stayed at Riverside and were not disappointed. This time we stayed in the Alligator Bayou rooms-which are exellant, and have a rustic feel; I liked these better than the Mansion rooms. The beds were very comfortable. The food court has many choices, one of my favorite is the Mickey waffle with strawberries. The gift shop is also great! One feature that keeps us coming to Port Orleans is their boat service to Downtown Disney. This is such a relaxing ride, and much better than taking the bus. It is also a short walk over to French Quarter. On evening we walked over to French Quarter and had a drink at their lounge (highly recommended is the Tropical Ginger Lemonade [I think that is the name]) and relaxed while looking at the Christmas decorations. The only bad part about the building our room was in is that there was no elevator in that building (some buildings have them and some don't). Overall I was very happy with our stay and highly recommend both Riverside and French Quarter.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Lenny Mills","date":"2013-02-08 14:55:33 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Marley Kuvalis"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Comfortable family run hotel with spectacular views and superb food produced from best local produce.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
