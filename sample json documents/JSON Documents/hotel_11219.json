I get the impression that this hotel is meant more for business travelers - I don't remember seeing any other families. The pool is very nice - spacious and plenty of seating. There is a hot tub but it is indoors in the spa / workout area. We stayed on the 5th floor and had very nice views. The only thing keeping me from giving this hotel 5 stars is that housekeeping left a bit to be desired. It was noticeable that they hadn't cleaned behind the bathroom door in some time - lots of fingerprints etc. Maybe that's just my own pickiness. Also on the last 24 hours of stay we were literally rationing toilet paper (not replenished by housekeeping) and did without wash cloths - they left us 1 for a room that accomodates 4 guests. I know that we could have asked for more - but in this type of hotel I expect those things to be handled without my having to ask.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":4.0},"author":"Mrs. Winifred Ernser","date":"2013-09-12 02:57:37 +0300"},{"content":"Nice lobby with pleasant staff, but few things that were annoying. I ordered room service and after 1 hour I called to find out the chef \"was confused\" and forgot my order...now it would take 20-30 more minutes. Had I not called, it would have not been acknowledged. They should have called about the problem. Instead of apology, I was told it was busy (excuses instead of owning up) but I was given a free beer. Another thing was I heard the doorman and shuttle driver referring to \"them Koreans\" which I later learned was the staff of Korean airlines who stay there. While not horrible, they were making comments that could be interpreted as derogatory had they heard. Overall ok, but not great","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":2.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Mr. Beryl Donnelly","date":"2013-03-20 12:35:02 +0300"},{"content":"My number one requirement is cleanliness and this entire hotel was spotless. Top marks also go to the huge rooms with queen beds, amazing staff and larger fitness center with well appointed and maintained equipment. I stayed at this hotel for a wedding and received a room rate that is practically unheard of. And the reception was AMAZING! Nice work. My only issue was the requirement of a rental car but I think thatâ€™s a Dallas thing â€“ itâ€™s a land of highways and strip malls so donâ€™t expect public transportation or the ability to walk places :(","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Wendy Nikolaus","date":"2015-11-26 12:31:09 +0300"},{"content":"FIrst of all Id like to start off with something I noticed other reviews: I dont understand how people can give a hotel bad ratings overall just because they dont like the location. Sure you cant walk to places to eat or shop from the hotel but you knew this when you mad a reservation here, its not the hotels fault you cant use a map! Ok, with that being said I booked this hotel for a last minute stay int he area, I normally like to stay more towards the center of Dallas but with a rate of $92 all in I figured I couldnt go wrong. An additional incentive to me was their comp. self parking in a garage, I dont mind paying to park but I dont trust most valets with some of my diff. cars. When I arrived at the hotel I noticed while about 15 minutes to downtown it was right off the expressway so it was no problem to get anywhere in the city in a decent amount of time. The bell staff were quick to collect my bags and take me to my room. The rooms werent very large but were decorated very nicely as the rest of the hotel was and were more then adequate for 1 or 2 people. I did not notice any elevator noise as some complained of. The only downside I noticed on the hard product the outside of the hotel could use a good pressure cleaning or fresh paint. Service was where the Omni really impressed me. Ive stayed at lots of 5-Diamond hotels that would have trouble keeping up with the Omni's service standard. I was always greeted very quickly and by name. Everything was done quickly when I requested it and I never once heard a no. I had one unusual request that they had no need to fulfill but they did it for me anyways, I was very impressed! I normally do not eat at the hotels as I like to go to local, well known establishments when Im in different cities. However, one night I was extremely tired and not very hungry. I ordered a childrens cheese burger with french fries (probably the same size as the adult burger!), ice cream for dessert and a bottle of Pellegrino water, for around $12. The quality was very good as well. I would not hesitate to stay here again, very good job to everyone at the Omni!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Mr. Lilla Beahan","date":"2015-03-02 22:19:30 +0300"},{"content":"I book two to three dozen conferences a year around the country and the staff at the Omni West were the very best to deliver exactly what I asked for but more. Their attention to detail and professionalism exceeded my expectations. I will look for other Omnis in other cities due to the fact that the Omni West was so perfect! My conferences are attended by personel and future clients, therefore it is very important to get the details right. I was especially impressed by a young lady named Audrey, who made sure everything went as planned. (Would love to hire her away from the Omni but she is a very loyal employee of the company)","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Jessica Corwin","date":"2012-08-25 16:28:32 +0300"},{"content":"I was very impressed by the service I recieved at this hotel. It was my birthday weekend and the staff went the extra mile to make me feel special. After dinner, we walked into my hotel and found a birthday cake slice! If that isn't knowing your customer, I'm not sure what is. The staff even gave suggestions on the activites to do around the area. They never appeared too busy to help or annoyed by any question. The room was very comfortable and had a nice view. What a bed! You just sink into it. Overall this is the best hotel I have booked, and I enjoy staying at high rated hotels. Also, the price was pretty good. The location was good because it is withen 15 minutes of most activites that I enjoy.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Tessie Wyman","date":"2014-06-25 03:22:18 +0300"},{"content":"I spent three nights recently at the Omni while I was attending a conference. I was given an executive suite on the 4th floor and the room was perfect. It was spacious, with separate sleeping and living areas. It was decorated stylishly and well-equipped with two flat-screen TVs, a desk, comfortable sofa etc. The staff I met were excellent. When checking in, the receptionist warned me my room was close to elevators and gave me an opportunity to swap rooms if I needed to. A nice, customer-friendly touch. I used room service on one of the nights I was there. It was Ok, nothing special, but the prices seemed typical for a hotel of this quality. I didn't try any of the hotel restaurants. The Omni is about 10 miles from downtown Dallas and access by car is easy as the hotel is situated close to the highway. DFW is also very close by.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Larue Klein","date":"2014-07-13 15:38:46 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Reagan Tremblay","Lisette Davis","Miss Esmeralda Waters","Rosamond Barton","Santa Torphy","Karson Waters","Emmitt Terry","Birdie Rempel"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Self-catering 3 bedroom 4 star bungalow lies in a quiet cul-de-sac off A496 in Southern Snowdonia, has a fine view of the World Heritage Site, off-road parking: close to railway station.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":true}
