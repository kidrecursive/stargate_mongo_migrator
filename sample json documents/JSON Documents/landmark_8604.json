It is part of the J. D. Wetherspoon chain and always has a wide range of drinks at quite cheap prices - a pint of locally brewed Caledonian IPA [http://www.caledonian-brewery.co.uk] is about £2, pint of beer and burger £7. They also serve typical pub food and again some of the special offers make the food very reasonable. Like most Wetherspoons it's good value but a bit soulless. They also run The Alexander Graham Bell, 128 George Street, near Charlotte Square.","geo":{"lat":55.9528,"lon":-3.19944,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":8604,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Edinburgh","state":null}
