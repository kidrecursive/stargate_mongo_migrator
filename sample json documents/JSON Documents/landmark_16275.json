It includes a large field dedicated to Soccer and Cricket and tennis courts. It was originally the private garden of Holland House, much of which was destroyed. As you walk around the park, you can see bits of the building dotted around the place which give you some idea of how grand it used to be. In the summer this is a great place to catch outdoor opera. An ecology center is located near the police station that provides information about the ecology of the park and arranges various activities for children. A cafe is located nearby that provides ice creams and hot food. The park is an ideal way to walk from Notting Hill Gate to Kensington High St.","geo":{"lat":51.5028,"lon":-0.2038,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16275,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null,"image_direct_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Holland-Park-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1-%D9%87%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%83.JPG"}
