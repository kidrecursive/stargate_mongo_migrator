Grounds are beautiful and clean. Rooms are a little dated, but nice & clean. Customer service very accomodating to our needs. The resort is within driving distance to everything. We loved that the beach was less crowded than Ka'anapali. Golf course was gorgeous and amazing. Great place for snorkeling in the morning. A popular spot for a turtle viewing area within swimming distance of hotel. We swam with the turtles. Closest boat ride to Molokini (10 minute boat ride). Before we booked our vacation, we did our homework on all the different options on hotels and it paid off for us, as everything was perfect. We had a blast! We will go again for sure!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Brian Prosacco MD","date":"2015-10-26 07:42:28 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed here for our wedding and honeymoon. What an amazing place! From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed and made very comfortable. Our reservations had been accidently cancelled, by a third party travel agent. The reservations desk staff, were very helpful and explained in detail what had happened. She also upgraded our room and we got a better price, than what we had originally booked. The room was exceptional! Very clean, nicely decorated and a great patio, with a view of the ocean. We woke up each morning, opened the patio door, and listened to the ocean. The beds and pillows were the most comfortable in any hotel room, I've ever stayed. Every time we left our room, we were greeted by the nice staff, the grounds people and the front desk staff. Everyone was so friendly and always asked if there was anything we needed or anything they could do for us, to make our stay better. After staying a few nights we were suppose to transfer to a condo in Kihei. We ended up adding another night and gave up our condo. My husband and I have already talked about going back to the Makena beach Resort for our 1st anniversary.","ratings":{"Overall":5.0},"author":"Miss Providenci Fisher","date":"2012-04-25 02:09:55 +0300"},{"content":"Lukewarm staff, sketchy housekeeping, worn beach towels (if you can get them, as they tend to run out). Got charged $5 \"room service delivery fee\" to borrow some plates/silverware for use in the room â€“ something we have never encountered elsewhere. Rooms are worn and carpet is dirty. Found other people's hair in room upon arrival and housekeeping appears to do minimal in the rooms during our stay. Also had problem with people in adjacent rooms smoking on their lanai â€“ prohibited by hotel but nothing you can do because the rooms do not face each other and you have no idea which room it is coming from. However, very, very quiet hotel and great for couples wanting to get away. Great access to beach and free beach chairs are fairly plentiful, especially in the afternoon. Parking was very easy. Recommend this hotel if you can get it for good price and can overlook their shortcomings (mostly the oldness and cost cutting). Found several mistakes on our bill at check out so please review before you sign.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Gaetano Wolff","date":"2015-09-11 18:35:23 +0300"},{"content":"First, to qualify this review, let me say that my husband and I have stayed at the \"Pink Palace\" in Waikiki, the Mauna Lani on the Big Island (twice), and the Bora Bora Nui & Intercontinental (Papeete) in French Polynesia. We live in an ocean resort on the Atlantic (Maryland), so we are no newcomers to beach/resort hotels (at the high end). As frequent travelers, we rely pretty heavily on the reviews posted here in our decision making. I am barely able to post this review, because I fear, that if word gets out about this hotel, no one will ever be able to get a room here again. So, here goes: If you want a pretty secluded and safe beach, it's here (remember-all beaches are public in HI); if you want a very affordable, decent rate for an ocean-front no frills hotel, it's here; if you want the feel of 'old Hawaii' with all of the Aloha and the Wailea location, it's here; great food--not here, good food, yes, but not great; best sunset lounge that's not on the beach, it's here; big-time, over-the-top nightlife, not here, but good Hawaiian entertainment several nites during the week, it's here; friendly staff--Jay, Kai, Michelle, Amy to name a few--nothing is ever a problem; great bed, clean room with plenty of towels, soap, etc, it's here; if you want lots of kiddie amenities, maybe another choice is wiser; if you want quiet, quiet, quiet, a large hotel and grounds where you have space to wander and relax, this is it. If you need glitz and noise, overworked valets, and stroller races in the lobby (yes, I witnessed this on a walk-through at another hotel that has a \"four\" in its name), then go for all of that at the mouth of Wailea. Makena Beach (formerly the Maui Prince) is a wonderful alternative to the overpriced crowded chaos at the other end of this road. We are only sorry we could not stay longer--8 nites was not long enough at this little spot on Maui. (And yes, do eat at Mama's & Gannon's & Da Kitchen in Lahaina. -- all good, really good.) We're still trying to figure our review on Spago at the \"4 . . . Hotel.\"","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Shanny Nienow","date":"2012-07-24 12:35:26 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed in an ocean front room, the view was super, being able to snorkel in back of the hotel wonderful, can't beat the Sunday brunch, room service especially good, staff could not have been nicer or more helpful, and we thought the gardens beautiful. We got a very good deal for the 7 nights that we were there, around 200 a night. Yes, it was quiet, but we had the pool and jacuzzi to ourselves, and we were often out on road trips.
