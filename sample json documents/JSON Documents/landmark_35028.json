{"title":"Los Angeles/Northwest","name":"Griffith Park","alt":null,"address":null,"directions":null,"phone":null,"tollfree":null,"email":null,"url":null,"hours":null,"image":null,"price":null,"content":"A large municipal park at the eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains in Los Feliz. The park covers 4,210 acres of land, making it one of the largest urban parks in North America. It has also been referred to as the Central Park of Los Angeles, but it is much larger and with a much more untamed, rugged character. Griffith is a great place for hikes, picnics or hanging around with friends. The hiking trails lead up to Mulholland Drive, and provide great views of the city. One of the main hiking trails is located on Bronson Ave. The street will end leading up to the trail. Griffith Park has several attractions for kids, including the L.A. Zoo, &quot;Travel Town&quot; which is a free exhibition of old trains and model trains with trains rides for children ($3), the Autry western museum, pony rides, a golf course, driving range, horseback riding, and a Christmas light drive in December (expect traffic).","geo":{"lat":34.13511,"lon":-118.296332,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":35028,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
