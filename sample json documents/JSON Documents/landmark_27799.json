Happy Hour is Mon-Fri and you can get margaritas and tacos for cheap. Chips and salsa are housemade and so popular the owner sells them throughout the state at grocery stores. Nice little patio out back that is great for lunch.","geo":{"lat":38.293383,"lon":-122.455849,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":27799,"country":"United States","city":"Sonoma","state":"California"}
