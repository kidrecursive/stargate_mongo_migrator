The top of the mountain is adorned by the '''Mount Soledad Easter Cross and Veterans Memorial'''. It is home to many rabbits and couples. Sunrise and sunset are the two favorite times to go here. The twisty roads leading to the hill are full of plant life and give access to multimillion dollar hobbit homes which look much smaller from the street than from down below, as they are on a sloping hill. There are a few hairpin turns and tight bridges that are worth finding.","geo":{"lat":32.83979,"lon":-117.24467,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25174,"country":"United States","city":"San Diego","state":"California"}
