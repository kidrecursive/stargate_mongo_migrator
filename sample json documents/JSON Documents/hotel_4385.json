Often we come for the day but the past two years we have stayed for a few nights. The rooms are very basic and \"look\" affordable but the pricing scheme is sneaky...read the fine print especially if traveling with young children and especially if you've reserved 2 queens, the family unit, or the suite. Bottom line is that I was overcharged in a very misleading manner and when I took this up with management they were unwilling to do anything about it. The service was the worst I have ever received from any business that I have ever dealt with...no joke. One of the employees even threatened to call the police on my family and I. When I spoke to the manager about the treatment I received from the employee, she replied that she would \"talk to her about it.\" Not exactly the response I was looking for. I will say that the pools are great, especially for young kids however, for the price we ended up being charged we could've rented an oceanfront beach house (seriously, I looked into it). I am heartbroken that one of our favorite places has become such a horrible disappointment. We will not be going back, nor will we be recommending the Calistoga Spa to any of our friends. Just the thought of dealing with the staff and management makes me cringe. With so many other great spas in Calistoga, I would choose another place to stay if I were a new comer.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":2.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":2.0},"author":"Mrs. Susan Jacobi","date":"2013-10-02 05:10:00 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed 2 nights at the hotel. PLUSES: Friendly staff. The 4 Mineral pools were great. I loved the kiddie pool 1.5 feet high. Room and facility are very clean! The location is fantastic; the main street is literally just one block away from the hotel. We had lunch at the Palisades Market, their gourmet sandwiches are wonderful! Close to wineries. Having a kitchen is geat, though it would be nice if they have a microwave! Washer/dryer only 75cents a load. Pools open long hours from 8am-11pm. CONS: Dissappointed with the decor and style of the hotel when first arrived - 80's decor. A/C unit is loud! My mud bath experience was OK, expecting a little more pampering and refreshing.","ratings":{"Overall":3.0},"author":"Ines Hansen","date":"2014-05-25 01:58:40 +0300"},{"content":"I just want to thank you for a great experience. Four of us stayed in your King George Suite. The room was delightful and perfect for us. The large living room gave us space to sit and chat, have coffee and drink some wine. Upon arriving home I found I had left some items in the room. No problem! A quick call to Cedrick at the desk and the items were promptly mailed and arrived in just a couple of days. Thanks to all the staff for keeping the place clean and inviting; the atmosphere relaxing; and the price was a bargain!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Levi West","date":"2013-05-01 00:42:02 +0300"},{"content":"If you're after a memorable accommodation as you explore the neighbouring wineries then this isn't it. That said it's a perfectly suitable place to lay your head in between wine stops and we'd use it again on that basis.

The motel exceeded our expectations. It was clean and comfortable. We stayed in a king-bed room on the first floor that was part of the newer units behind the older units. Most of all, it was quiet which was a nice surprise given the fact that it is right on the main highway running from Napa to St. Helena. The continental breakfast worked out well â€“ cereal, fruit, pastry of some sort, yogurt, juice and, of course, coffee or tea. It has a great location for exploring the wine country. It is reasonably priced.","ratings":{"Overall":5.0},"author":"Brennon Brown DDS","date":"2013-06-12 03:30:35 +0300"},{"content":"My wife and I stayed here recently for a couple of nights and enjoyed it. It's right on Highway 29 just south of St. Helena. When you approach the place it looks quite ordinary and that's part of its charm. We stayed in one of the poolside rooms which is a little misleading as you have to cross the entry loop to get to the pool and spa. The room was small but comfortable and very clean. We enjoyed the pool, spa area. It was very well maintained but quite noisy as it's right beside the highway. We had a glass of wine in the garden area away from the highway where it's quieter. The continental breakfast was average. I guess what really makes this place is its location as it's close to downtown, good restaurants and some of the best wineries in Napa Valley.
