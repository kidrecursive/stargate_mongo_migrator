After being closed to the public for over a century, this four-mile collection of flat walking trails comes not only with the views you see in a wildlife preserve, but also of places such as San Pablo Bay, Mt. Diablo, the Carquinez Strait, the East Bay hills, Mt. Tamalpais and the Sonoma and Napa Valleys. Because the trail is only to be used on foot, there is a rack to park your bike in the parking lot.","geo":{"lat":38.10053,"lon":-122.28513,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":31961,"country":"United States","city":"Vallejo","state":"California"}
