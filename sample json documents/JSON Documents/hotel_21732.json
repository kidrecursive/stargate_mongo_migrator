The room was beautiful, and the hotel itself very grand-- full of statues, flowers, fountains, beautiful sitting areas -- and then you get to the water park. Oh my goodness. They have GREAT waterslides, a water volcano, waterfalls, a pool-river that you can float along WITH rapids, a rope swing, and more. They even have a \"water elevator\" (which we did not try). We were there during the summer, so all of these attractions were quite packed with children (especially the water rapids slide, which was like a bowling alley of 9 year olds)-- but we 30-somethings managed to squeeze in and partake... It was fun! They also have one adult-only pool (which has a lot of adults lounging in it with Mai Tais)... so that one was pleasantly low-key... One thing I would say as a problem is the premium you have to pay for shade on the pool deck ($150 for the minimum two-chair accordion umbrella coverage, and goodness knows how much for a cabana). The sun is very hot and strong-- or at least it was when we were there in August. Down in the children's area, there are a few free thatch umbrellas (though people seemed to take the chairs under those quite early in the morning), but it's noisy down there-- not a super relaxing place to sit if you're a couple without kids. On the beach area you can rent an umbrella-- not sure how much that is, but I just think, if you are paying that much for a room, they shouldn't be so stingy with the shade. We have stayed at less expensive beach hotels elsewhere in the world (Mexico, Bermuda) where beach umbrellas were part of the deal... Anyway, we just stayed here one night, as we wanted to move around Maui and spend our days out touring and snorkeling, etc (if we are paying that much for a hotel, we didn't want to be out doing activities all day). One day/night was good to experience the \"oh WOW\" factor, but of course, two nights or more will be more relaxing... All depends on your budget!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Ms. Nikko Cummerata","date":"2015-10-27 00:58:30 +0300"},{"content":"Just returned from Maui where we planned to spend 10 days at the Grand Wailea. The setting is beautiful but the rooms, the staff, the cleanliness and the service left us wondering what we were paying so much money for. Our room suffered from deferred maintenance; the bedding was not clean; the mattress was broken down on one side; the tile in the bathroom was stained and often not cleaned well by housekeeping; the shower head leaked more water from the valve than it sprayed. When asked to leave extra towels, housekeeping simply took the tip and moved the note to the nightstand, ignoring the request entirely. We reserved and paid $275.00 in advance for a cabana at the pool and had to spend the entire day policing the chairs that were included with the cabana because the hotel does not provide different towels to indicate that those are reserved chairs. When we asked for a different cabana location after our third day in the same one (we wanted a change of scenery), we were told that we could have that same cabana or none. The food was mediocre at best, and very expensive, although the wait staff at every place we ate was friendly and helpful. On the fourth day we sought the assistance of a manager for the smelly bedding and inability to get enough towels for each of us to have just one. The solution was to remove the feather bed and down comforter and leave us with a lightweight blanket and cheap mattress pad. The attitude was \"if you don't like it we can make it worse for you.\" Our bill was in excess of $1200. per day with the standard room in the lagoon wing, cabana and food we charged to the room-not worth it for that kind of attitude! We checked out on the fifth day and moved to The Four Seasons where we had exquisite service, food and our room was clean and free of deferred maintenance. Our bill was much lower and our vacation was revived.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Check in / front desk":4.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":1.0},"author":"Stuart Hermiston V","date":"2012-08-04 18:13:34 +0300"},{"content":"We just completed another stay at the GWR in late may early June and we had a great time. What the Grand Wailea is: Very expensive, cannot be mentioned in the same sentence with Four Seasons, Ritz and JW's in service; mediocre in food and has the audacity to charge handsomely for shade at the pool. Why do we keep coming back? The resort itself is amazing. The pools are the highlight, the beach is one of the best anywhere, the offshore reef is an easy swim to see the sea turtles, and the artwork and gardens make you feel like you've found paradise. We were guests in 1991 when the resort opened and again shortly after the hotel was award 5 Diamonds so we are dissapointed that the hotel has becom indifferent to all the small things that differentiate a good resort from a great one. But let's face it, this place is fun, beautiful and if you are a business person who spends significant time away from the family, the GWR allows you to have fun together as a family and reconnect. To maximize your enjoyment of the resort you need to go in understanding that you won't have the personal service of the 4S, yes a drink will cost $13 at the pool and this is an activity based resort, lot's of kids and adults who are acting like kids. If you want quiet this is not the place for you. My last advice is eat offsite when you can. We had great meals at Joe's at the Wailea tennis club go at sunset and order the pumpkin seed coated Mahi. If you're in the mood for a steak, Ruth Chris is next door. We had a poor experience at Nick's at the Fairmont (dry Mahi and a very stingy poor of Sonoma Cutrer for $15).","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Kaylee Lowe","date":"2015-04-21 05:14:34 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed at the Grand Wailea with our 10 yr old son May 5-10. We all loved it. The grounds are very well maintained and the pool is great fun. The only somewhat negative factor is that the hotel is located somewhat far from the main cities/areas of Maui. There are no waves on Wailea beach so we had to go to Lahaina for surfing and that was about 45 minutes away. We stayed in the Napua tower and enjoyed the morning breakfast and afternoon appetizers and cocktails. I also went to the spa and it was amazing. I have been to many spas but none quite as pampering as the Grand. My husband said he enjoyed the gym and that is was large for a hotel gym. We did not have any problems getting chairs on the beach or by the pool as others have mentioned. I guess we went not on a peak time for Hawaii.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Jaunita Miller","date":"2013-04-25 16:39:50 +0300"},{"content":"After a long business trip to Phoenix we (my son and I) decided to take a quick weekend vacation from Honolulu at the Grand Wailea in Maui. As soon as our taxi from the airport arrived at the hotel the bellhop happly opened the door and gave us leis and offered to take our bags, aftering accepting there offer they directed us to the check in desk. The line was rather long but it went rather quickly. After receiving our room keys the same bellhop that assisted us upon arrival showed us to our rooms and asked if there was anything else we needed. After he left we toured our room which was actually very nice, but deffinatlly not worth the $700 price tag. The bathroom was very nice and very clean, but in other parts of the room there were defiant signs of aging as you could see wood chips missing from the closet door and from the bathroom door. But overall the only thing that really I disliked was the fact that there was a stain on one of our pillows that looked of blood. Emidiately we called house keeping who showed up very shortly (withing 10 minutes) and genuanly apologised for the inconvenience. After looking at our room we toured the property and decided to try and go for a swim aftering getting into our swimsuits and going down to the pool it was shocking to find out that towels were not being given out beyond six even though the pool was open till 10:00. So we went back up to the room ordered room service and ended the day. On our first day we went to the pool at about 10 AM and found the pools to be absolutley amazing, but at the same time very crowded with other familys. The adult pool though was like walking into another world it was very quite and had attentative service. One thing we were very happy about though was that there were pool chairs avaliable, becaue after reading the horror stories of having to come out at six in the morning to get a chair we began to worry. Later on that evening me and my son decided to go to the spa for the evening and both agreed that it was above and beyond what we had expected. On our last day at the Grand Wailea we came out to the pool at noon and to our amazment the horror stories were true no chairs were avaliable, but and excellent pool staff member gladly helped up out by finding us two chairs. She even offered to get our pool towels and wrist bands for us as an apology, but we declained not wanting to be a burdan. Overall our stay at the Grand Walea was very good, not worth $700 a night but still very good.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Jaime Leuschke","date":"2013-05-26 02:54:14 +0300"},{"content":"There's not enough I can say about the Grand Wailea. We have stayed there 3 times in the past 6 years and have another vacation booked there in April. If you look at the pictures on their website, you can see that the property is very luxurious and opulent. The photos don't do it justice! It is truly like staying in paradise. There's something for everyone there...of all ages. You could stay at the Grand for an entire week and never leave the hotel and have a tremendous time! What really struck me, however, was the \"ohana' (family) spirit there...although the setting is so elegant, you can feel very relaxed in the most casual clothing and not have to feel like you're \"keeping up with the Jones's\" The staff go out of their way to make you feel at home, even though the place is so large. I would recommend this hotel to anyone! The only downside perhaps, is the high price. What we've done sometimes is split our stay between this and another more reasonably priced hotel to make the vacation more affordable.
