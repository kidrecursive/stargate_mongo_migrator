Covering 647 hectares (1,600 acres), the estate is split into four main elements: Threave House, a restored Scottish baronial-style house; Threave Garden, made up of landscaped gardens and themed ‘rooms’; Threave Sculpture Garden, containing over 30 works by Scottish sculptors; and Threave Nature Reserve, featuring landscape ranging from wetlands to woodlands. Whichever part of the estate you’re in, you’ll see some of Threave’s famous wildlife – it’s one of Scotland’s bat hotspots, as well as a wildfowl sanctuary, and birds of all kinds flock here throughout the year.","geo":{"lat":54.92566,"lon":-3.94688,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":5183,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Dumfries and Galloway","state":null}
