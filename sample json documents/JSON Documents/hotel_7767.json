It was a very busy weekend in SF, there was a marathon going on right across the street. Perhaps this explained the outrageous room charges! We have traveled extensively to NYC and other expensive cities, and never before have I felt so ripped off by a hotel room rate. Good: The Chancellor is in a great location right at Union Square. There is loads of shopping, you can walk to the Ferry Building, lots of public transport nearby. Not so good: The Chancellor has been \"renovated\" but still felt dingy, especially the bathroom, which felt downright old. Although the linens and comforter were nice, the bed was lumpy. Bad: No air conditioner. I know this is made clear on their website, and I thought it would be ok, seeing how SF gets into the 50's at night. However, the windows only open about 6 inches (there is a safety mechanism so they won't open further), so there is really no fresh air in the room. The fan only circulates the hot air that is already in the room. Thus, at night, the room didn't cool down at all and was uncomfortably hot and stuffy, I would not stay here again, unless the room rate was 150 or less. The coffee is nice, but if the hotel really wanted to be standout, they might consider offering some sort of breakfast.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":1.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Mrs. Eloy Lueilwitz","date":"2014-04-05 15:50:26 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed here for 3 nights on our California / Nevada road trip... I only wish I could have stayed for longer! We loved the Chancellor. It has a feel of a lovely old hotel with a lot of heritage. It isn't one of the glitzy modern hotels but it it is classy, comfortable and friendly. Its location is perfect, right in the very heartbeat of SF. We were able to get a cable car straight from the Pier to the hotel, and every shop you could possibly imagine was right under our noses. The coffee & cookies in the lobby were a really nice touch, thank you! The irish barman was very friendly and genuine... one of the few who actually deserve a tip!!","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Hellen Crist","date":"2013-04-01 10:27:14 +0300"},{"content":"Understated elegance in minimalist euro style. Small, but who needs more when you're there to see the sites and eat great food. Only things missing are in-room coffee and air (unusually warm SF week made room stuffy and only way to cool was to open window to street - even this urbanite couldn't sleep with the noise). Everyone was exceedingly helpful, especially Matt. Wish NY had locations this nice at these prices - truly amazing value.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Cielo Bailey","date":"2013-11-10 20:17:40 +0300"},{"content":"My wife and I stayed 3 nights at the Chancellor. As a matter of fact I am writing this review from the SFO airport while waiting for our flight home. This was a fine lace to stay if you are looking for lodging in the Union Square area. We got a rate of $145/n. after tax it was about $165. Although the room was small, but I understand this is normal for SF in the $ range, it was very clean. I never saw one bug or dust bunny and the bed was also very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. The Chancellor is right on the PowellandMason / Powell and Hyde Cable car lines. Hop on and your in Fisherman's Wharf in 15 minutesor walk a short distance to Market St.and hop a streetcar and ride that way. Definitely by a\"passport\" the Muni pass. We bought the passport foe 3 days / $21. It gets you on allMuni buses and cablecars. Cablecar rides without are $6 each way.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Mrs. Douglas Rempel","date":"2014-06-07 06:43:15 +0300"}],"public_likes":[],"vacancy":false,"description":"This Grade II listed hotel is home to 38 luxury bedrooms with state of the art technology along with a mini spa and treatment rooms, conference rooms, residents' bar, private dining leading from the 80 cover fine dining restaurant in the grandeur of a ballroom and not forgetting the exclusive Chef's table experience - the first of its kind in the area.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":false,"free_parking":false}
