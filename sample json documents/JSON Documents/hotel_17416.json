We went for the highest room (Casa Nova) in the hotel which has a sky window that opens up to see the sky at night, it was very romantic. Breakfast was truly a gem - the croissants are made fresh and they tasted super delicious. There are only two tables that are out on the balcony so people have to wait for the outdoor tables. They offer free water taxi rides to the glass factory on Murano island, but it was a complete waste of time. Transport organized by the hotel to the island was perfect, but the hotel didn't arrange our transportation back and we were stuff with like 10 other people in small boat which made us completely soaked on our way back. The boat did not stop back at our hotel but just dropped us off, all soaked, at St. Mark's Square. It was the worst boat ride. Avoid the hotel's free ticket to Murano at all, you can better spend your time in Venice doing something else.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Service":4.0},"author":"Boyd Ritchie","date":"2015-05-05 05:44:24 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed at the Hotel Canal Grande after a cruise and catching the train from Rome. It is very close to the station but a tricky walk over stairs if you have heavy luggage. The staff gave us very easy directions and we found it no worries. First night they put us in the new section, spotlessly clean and traditionally decorated in venetian style with the tv in the mirror. However it is not right on the canal but a couple of doors down. After a request they did everything they could to upgrade us for a small charge and move us to the blue room which has a canal view. The room has a four poster bed luxurious curtains and space to move. It has windows that open on to the canal and has double glazing so you don't hear a thing at night. A beautifully decorated room. The hotel is close to some very nice restaurants and the staff are full of helpful hints. We had breakfast (delicious and plentiful) and drinks at night to watch the sunset on the little deck. A fabulous place to watch the venetians go about their daily business. The hotel is very close to several public ferry stops and we booked a private boat to take us to the airport, a little pricey (A$100) but we saw another side of Venice and it surely beats dragging suitcases to buses etc. Overall we highly recommend this hotel for its location, staff and cleanliness. You wont be disappointed.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Katarina Medhurst","date":"2014-04-09 08:07:29 +0300"},{"content":"My wife and I had 2 nights at Hotel Canal Grande before joining a Mediterranean Cruise, and we loved it! When we were shown to our room we just looked at each other, speechless â€“ it was stunning. Having spent many hours planning our holiday and making all the bookings this was a very satisfying moment. This was our first visit to Venice and the city (and this hotel) took our breath away. It wonâ€™t be our last visit. We were in the room (101) named after Rosalba Carriera (a female Venetian portrait painter), which had a partial Canal view through one of several windows that opened up on to the adjacent Campo. The location is fantastic â€“ close to the train station (although you would never know it was there), and a 5 minute stroll to either of two Vaporetto stops. The room was luxuriously furnished, with a nice sized bathroom featuring a big bath (which had a canal view!). The bed was very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was a modest affair â€“ not one of their strong points, but if you were lucky you could get a table on the small landing looking out directly on to the Grand Canal. We enjoyed gin & tonics out there one afternoon. There was one free Internet point adjacent to reception which wasnâ€™t too busy. We got a good restaurant recommendation from the front desk and overall the service was very good, especially from Gianni â€“ we would happily have stayed here for quite a bit longer! The hotel is a fair hike from the tourist hot spots like the Rialto Bridge and Piazza San Marco but Iâ€™m counting that as a positive, as it can get crazy in Venice. Thatâ€™s not to say that it isnâ€™t close to a plethora of shops and restaurants, just that you wonâ€™t be over-run in the endless stampede of tour groups. Make sure to visit the nearby gelato shop Alaska â€“ it is legendary. One word of caution â€“ although the hotel is only about 500m from the train station, the Scalzi Bridge is not to be tackled with heavy luggage. My personal trainer will be impressed that I manhandled two bulging 20kg suitcases up and down the 48 steps (I counted them later) but it was a foolhardy exercise. The better option if you have heavy luggage is to pay for a water taxi â€“ damn the expense!","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":4.0},"author":"Aaron Wilkinson","date":"2014-03-05 01:58:10 +0300"},{"content":"Giovamme of the Hotel Grand Canal Venice was so amazing, most helpful, friendliest, most courteous staff of this beautiful hotel.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Emmett VonRueden","date":"2014-06-17 08:02:57 +0300"},{"content":"My mum, sister and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, we chose it because of the comments on trip advisor and were not disappointed. The rooms were beautiful, comfortable and clean we had one room in the hotel and 2 rooms were in another building but this was not a problem. The breakfasts were good and lots of choice.The location could not have been better-we took a 5 euro bus from Marco Polo airport to the Piazzale Roma then crossed 2 bridges during a ten minute walk to the hotel, we were travelling light so did not find this too difficult. We purchased a 72 hour vaporetto pass for 33 euro and were pleased with how easy and convenient they were to use to get to all the places of interest- we certainly had our money worth, everything else was expensive...! Venice was wonderful and the Hotel Grande made it a very special visit.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Preston Wisoky","date":"2013-04-22 02:29:01 +0300"},{"content":"This hotel was right on the grand canal.
