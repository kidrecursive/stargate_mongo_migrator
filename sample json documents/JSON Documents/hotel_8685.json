The hotel looks OK from the highway and looked conveniently located. Should have known when the very unfriendly girl at the front desk gave me the room key wrapped in a post-it note because they had run out of the little envelopes. The room smelled weird, when we opened the chest drawers we saw what looked like small roaches, we never took anything out of the suitcase. It was very cold that night in Miami and the heating unit blew cold air. The next morning we woke up to find out there was no hot water in the whole hotel, after many calls and trips to the front desk I was informed that there was someone coming to fix the boiler. To make a long story short, the hot water came back on at 12:00pm; checkout time is 11:00am. They wanted us to leave without taking a shower, the maid was also annoyed at us because we didn't leave the room and she had to finish to go home. Later that night while at a restaurant in South Beach, I noticed some itchy bumps on the left side of the back of my neck and scalp, as well as the knuckles of my fingers, they turned out to be BED BUG BITES!!!","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":1.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Consuelo Thiel","date":"2013-03-28 07:41:35 +0300"},{"content":"Restaurant service was o.k. Your continental breakfast is a joke. We were there 2 nights. We had 4 rooms which were reserved in August 2008. The last couple to get there Friday niight got a terrible room. Nothing in it but the bed. They wre given a different room the next morning but the damage was done.

I have been staying at the Capri since 2001, when my family moved from SF to the North Bay. It used to be a great deal for us ex-pats and while not a luxury hotel, it was clean and comfortable (plus in a great location).My son and I stayed at the Capri this summer and we were terribly let down. They no longer offer specials and while there is renovation occurring, our room was dingy and the bed very uncomfortable. My 9 year old son said, Mom, let's not stay at the Capri anymore. Sadly, I had to agree.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":2.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Harry O'Kon I","date":"2014-09-10 11:07:33 +0300"},{"content":"Best Deal in the Marina If you don't mind 1960's decor this place will fit the bill. It's very reasonable and very clean. Sometimes it books up with the Euro tours. Ask to stay on the 3rd floor, with the high ceilings and roof windows. I have actually heard the fog horns at night. There is also plenty of free parking right on-site.This hotel is right off Union street and within walking distance of the Marina Green. Tons of great restaurants and clubs. One of my favorites is the Brazen Head, which is right across the street. A small English Pub with great food and drinks. It's hard to spot but there's a real small sign out front. Also, El Canasta (sp?) has a great steak burrito.","ratings":{"Service":-1.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":-1.0,"Check in / front desk":-1.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":-1.0,"Rooms":-1.0,"Location":-1.0},"author":"Sibyl Lind","date":"2014-09-20 18:19:21 +0300"},{"content":"Bed Bugs and Ants The ants didn't bother me. It was the bed bugs I detested.Before staying at the Buena Vista I didn't know what a bed bug looked. But the spots on my arms that looked like flea bites kept appearing after I got home. So I googled them.Yep, sure enough! Up popped a photo of the same type of bug that I had killed after I found it crawling on my husband's pillow while we were staying at the Buena Vista this January 2008!I ordered some all natural bed bug powder to dust all over my house. Even my kids are showing up with the spots.When I called the hotel after I got home to tell them about it they said they would block off that room. But when I called a day or two later there was someone in that room. It doesn't matter if they block off and treat one room. They've got to do the entire premises.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Deshawn Rippin","date":"2014-10-17 15:46:51 +0300"},{"content":"Not a great place to stay This place is falling apart...was once a nice little place to stay but not now.

The rooms were large and the housekeeping very good. The front desk service was always helpful and friendly with good advice. Traffic noise was not as bad as expected and nor was the beds. Only minus was the continental breakfast American style which differed somewhat from what we experienced in other countries. Too sweet for our taste.Overall a great experience and well located although being closer to eateries would have been appreciated. Can recommend the Liquor Store accross the road.
