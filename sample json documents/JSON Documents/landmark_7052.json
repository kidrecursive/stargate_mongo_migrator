All food is ordered directly from the bar and brought to you based on the oversized playing card you'll receive after paying.  The vibe is upscale hipster, with a younger, affluent crowd.  It gets extremely full and very noisy as the evening goes on, so consider an early arrival if you want a cushy lounge seat and the chance to talk to your dining companions without yelling.","geo":{"lat":33.99707,"lon":-118.42612,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":7052,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
