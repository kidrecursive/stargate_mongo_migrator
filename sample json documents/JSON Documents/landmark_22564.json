Just a short water bus ride of around five minutes from the '''Barbican Landing Stage''', followed by five to ten minutes on the SW Coastal Path, this is the perfect place for picnics, letting the kids run around and let off steam or just watching the world (and shipping!) go by. A small pebbly beach is located at the foot of Jennycliff, accessed down long but shallow (not steep) steps. There is also direct access onto the '''Southwest Coastal Path''' for longer walks to '''Heybrook, Wembury, Noss Mayo''' and beyond. A small caf√© with facilities is available.","geo":{"lat":50.351079,"lon":-4.121589,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":22564,"country":"United Kingdom","city":null,"state":null}
