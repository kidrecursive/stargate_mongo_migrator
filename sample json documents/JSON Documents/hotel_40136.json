I usually go for travelodge when I want good clean comfortable accommodation that is cheap. The hotel only managed to fulfill one of my criteria, it was cheap enough, but that was were the usual comparisons ended. It was not a clean hotel nor was our room comfortable, the bed linen was grubby, when I sat on the bed my bum was nearly touching the floor it sagged so much! The cleanliness of the bathroom left much to be desired and the staff were rude when I asked for an extra pillow, saying they didnt have any! I requested a quiet room as we had an early start, granted it is difficult in London to give you a quiet room but our room was on the first floor, opposite the bus and train station, and the door to the lift so quiet it definately was not. I would think twice before staying here again","ratings":{"Service":2.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Delia Kuhlman","date":"2012-08-27 23:18:08 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed at this hotel New Years Eve, the staff were very friendly on our arrival we were checked in easily no problems. We had a double room which was the typical Travelodge room basic no frills, once again just a pet hate of mine a double room has 2 people so why is there only 3 pillows I always have to ask for another one. Excellent location for all the train stations just over road from Euston and about 5 minutes to Kings Cross/ St Pancras. Breakfast was terrible though, eggs smelt of kippers, orange juice was just water with a bit of orange in it, We couldnt drink it. Bed was too soft and very lumpy Otherwise this is a reasonable hotel if you just want a base to sightsee its a perfect location for underground.

This is a budget hotel located across the road from Euston station. We were efficiently booked in by courteous staff. The room was basic but clean. Bed ok I have slept in a lot worse in more expensive hotels. TV in room and coffee tea making facilities. Bathroom clean and adequate for our needs. Had breakfast which was probably one of the best value breakfast I have had in a hotel, hot, tasty and plenty of it .Good location for transport to get around London. For the price I would certainly recommend this.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Arno Heathcote","date":"2012-10-11 10:06:50 +0300"},{"content":"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in April 2011 while attending a gig. Found the double room to be quite small, especially when compared with similar rooms offered by Premier Inn. The air conditioning did not seem to work and the cushions were poor. First morning's sleep was disturbed by a policeman shouting in at some guests 3 or 4 doors down. Looked like some form of negotiation was going on? On the good side it is conveniently located across the road from Euston tube and was easy to find.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Sleep Quality":2.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Marilie McLaughlin","date":"2015-10-28 02:34:21 +0300"},{"content":"Plus points - Ok rooms, basic mine but clean enough - Eating facilities and a bar - TV in room - Great location for Euston - Reasonable price Could be better - No hairdryer - No toiletries - Didnt like being in basment - Noisey with church bells ringing!","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":2.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Kali Kling","date":"2012-10-04 06:42:04 +0300"},{"content":"Stayed here for two nights in September 2011. The main draw was the location - my train got in late and I didn't want to be traipsing across the city - it is right next to Euston and about a 5 minute walk from Kings Cross. Euston is well equipped with shops, including an M&S food store so you can grab breakfast there! There is an automatic check in machine which was simple to operate. My double room was on the third floor and on the side street - there was some noise at night but not too much. The rollerblind shut out any light. The room was clean although a few of the fixtures, especially in the bathroom needed fixed or upgraded - eg the bathroom bin had a metal spike sticking out , one of the buttons on the shower was broken and a bedside lamp needed fixed. The bed was reasonably comfortable, and the room was equipped with a kettle and a flatscreen tv on the wall - it was next to the bed so you had to lie across it to see properly. All in all, its fine for a place to lay your head and the location is very convenient.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Service":3.0},"author":"Marilie Smith","date":"2012-09-15 23:10:25 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Jermain Skiles"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Hotel and restaurant","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
