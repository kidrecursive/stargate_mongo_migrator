There can be as many as 900 sea lions there during the winter months.  In the summertime many of them migrate but there is always a steady population at Pier 39's K-Dock all year round. The Marine Mammal Centerâ€™s Kiosk is located next to the sea lions where volunteers are happy to answer questions about the mammals.","geo":{"lat":37.8106,"lon":-122.4116,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25604,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
