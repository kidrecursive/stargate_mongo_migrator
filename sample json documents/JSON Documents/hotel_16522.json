The hotel is 14 months old with a very Euro feel to it. Excellent restaraunts, great service, good location that is close to Michigan Ave shopping. I upgraded when I got there to a 1 bedroom suite that was spacious and comfortable. The Spa has a great steam room, sauna, and whirlpool, and the workout room is clean with excellent machines. Breakfast was fantastic and prices were high, but reasonable. The staff was polite and very helpful. I enjoyed this hotel much more than the Four Seasons in Chicago. My only gripe was that the pillows were a little hard on the bed. The bathrooms, particularly the shower and bathtub were awesome. Internet was free, and the bellman would not accept a tip per hotel policy.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Maribel Bernhard","date":"2013-02-07 00:17:01 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Mr. Jose Bosco","Dejah Bailey","Rylee Quitzon","Connor Dooley","Florencio White","Jeremy Hayes","Jermey Bogan","Billie Wisoky","Onie Tromp"],"vacancy":true,"description":"A charming four star boutique hotel near Victoria station.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
