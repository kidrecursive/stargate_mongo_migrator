The staff are very friendly and are very generous on room upgrades for Platinum-level priorityclub programme members. Very nice King Suite provided, with great bathroom, quality bed and many other top fittings. Free WIFI in the lounge bar (after purchasing a drink) is very useful too. As per other reviews the hotel is perfectly located for quick and easy transfers back to any of the airport terminals.
