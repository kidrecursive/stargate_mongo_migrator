There is a small beach at the foot of the park where you'll see kayakers, kite fliers, swimmers from the nearby Polar Bear Club, and even rock sculptors at work. At the end of the park is Municipal Pier &mdash;  the closest you can get to Alcatraz on foot or bike. After dark it can be a bit desolate.","geo":{"lat":37.8068,"lon":-122.4229,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":25618,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
