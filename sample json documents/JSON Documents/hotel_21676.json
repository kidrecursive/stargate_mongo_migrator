Behind the distinctive 1970s facade are updated rooms and common areas with contemporary design and facilities. The hotel faces the Palais du Congres and caters mostly for business travellers and less so to tourists than other Starwood properties in Paris. This is the largest hotel by room count in Paris, with 1,025 rooms of various types. The less expensive Classic and Deluxe rooms have more dated decor, the Urban and Executive rooms have been thoroughly updated to 21st century standards.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
