Acts range from rock to reggae to folk and have included artists such as the Indigo Girls, Patti Smith, Los Lobos, Dick Dale and others.  There is no organized seating, so arrive early to stake out a spot and bring something soft to sit on since the pier can be hard (note that once concerts start most people end up standing).","geo":{"lat":34.00843,"lon":-118.49798,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"do","type":"landmark","id":26459,"country":"United States","city":"Santa Monica","state":"California"}
