Great place to wander around on a sunny day, or to sit and have a picnic. Highlights include the Rock Garden; the 165m long herbaceous border, backed by a huge, century old beech hedge (a hedge may not sound too exciting but this one has to be seen to be believed!); and the Victorian Temperate Palm House, which is the tallest of its kind in the UK. The stunning new ''John Hope Gateway'' building at the west gate opened in October 2009 and contains the new restaurant and shop, as well as permanent and temporary exhibitions.","geo":{"lat":55.96513,"lon":-3.20831,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":8686,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Edinburgh","state":null}
