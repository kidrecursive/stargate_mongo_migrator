This last time I was booking my business trip to San Diego I had decided to try another place just to see if I could discover another great get-a-way hotel. I won't say which one, but I checked into a very nice upscale hotel in the downtown and checked out the next morning to go back to The Inn at Sunset Cliffs. It's in an area that's just unbeatable. It's got the most amazing view of any of the hotels I've seen in Southern California, and a great helpful staff. The outside patio is a little beat up, but they make do with nice tables and chairs to enjoy the view. The rooms all look as if they've just been remodeled recently, and the location is a very laid back coffee shop/bakery type neighborhood. Love it, and hope you guys can find this place as lovely as I did.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Treva Hauck MD","date":"2014-12-13 09:08:39 +0300"},{"content":"View is gorgeous. Gardens are lovely. Pool is small. Rooms are redone aged motel. Beds are good quality. Culture of the staff is that it is incumbent upon the customer to tell them what they need when there is a problem and not incumbent upon the staff to initiate or be energetic/enthusiastic about solving the problems. And the problems I experienced were EGREGIOUS: the floors were dirty, found a long black hair on my pillow, the showerheads were not adjustable and spewed strong water horizontally across the shower, three piles of dog poop on the lawn outside our room went unpicked up for a day, the closet smelled moldy (the only place to hang the designer dress I'd bought for the wedding I was to attend!), the pricey ocean-\"view\" room did face the ocean but could not be seen from inside due to the small high windows AND the stairway that was adjacent to the windows (everyone upstairs walked up and down these stairs looking directly into my room!), and FINALLY THE WORST: when donning the bathrobe in the morning to head to the pool, I found an unwashed pack of used matches in the pocket: THE BATHROBE HAD BEEN WORN BEFORE AND NOT WASHED FOR MY STAY!!!! ICK. The staff responded to this extremely casually, did wash the robe and return it to my room, but NEVER offered to compensate me in any way. When talking with the manager the following Tuesday (first chance to catch him and I had to initiate the call even after an email to him delineating the problems!), he also was extremely casual, never offered to comp a night or offer me a free future night (traditional hotelier solutions), but went on at length about how he agreed with the items that were problems and how he'd fixed them or would fix them. NEVER ONE WORD about me the customer, about fixing my negative experience with him. When I finally said something about how cavalier they are and that any other hotel would offer me a comped night, he became extremely passive-aggressive and said that had I asked him for this at the outset, he would have comped me a night, in fact he would have comped me the whole weekend AND given me a future stay for free; but now that I was a bad customer (what?! I listened to him drag on for 20 minutes about his hotel!), he would not do a thing for me and in fact advised me that I was banned from his hotel. ROTLFMAO. Like I would EVER return! I then advised him that this was the problem with the staff culture at the hotel: they think it's incumbent upon the customer to pay them AND to advise them how to perform. I advised him that in the hotel industry it is, in fact, incumbent upon the hotelier to serve the customer who is paying them. So if you stay here be sure to 1. bring up every problem you have immediately with the staff when you discover it and have them fix it asap and maybe comp you a night if you have the seriously disgusting problems I had and 2. be sure to never indict the staff for their laissez faire attitude and responses or you'll get blamed for being an inadequate customer.","ratings":{"Service":1.0,"Cleanliness":1.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":1.0,"Sleep Quality":1.0,"Rooms":1.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Jaycee Lockman","date":"2014-12-29 06:46:28 +0300"},{"content":"great service, beautiful views and amazing rooms. the people that work there are super friendly and next time i go back to san diego i will definitely stay there again.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Mr. Harley Oberbrunner","date":"2012-05-27 14:17:27 +0300"},{"content":"My boyfriend and I drove from LA to San Diego and decided to stay one night at Sunset Cliffs to experience the more beachy side of San Diego before staying in the city for the new year. While driving into San Diego there was fog on the coast which had just happened that day. Due to this we were unable to experience the beautiful sunset at the cliffs as we couldn't even see the cliffs. However the hotel was great and very clean. We walked a short distance up the road and there was a drug store, resturants, liquor store so we were all set. There is also a gas station and great cafe just next door to the hotel so we had all we needed. It is a great location just on the edge of the town with what I expect to be amazing views.","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Jacklyn Mueller","date":"2014-12-11 10:03:57 +0300"},{"content":"I had heard about the Inn through Trip Advisor and fell in love with it! My boyfriend and I booked a weekend at the end of June. We stayed in the King Suite. We got there a little early on Friday, and they let us go in before check-in time. The pool is a little smaller than it looks in the virtual tour, but it's okay. The view is spectacular from the deck or from our window in the King Suite. I highly recommend this room. It's sort of small, but worth it, if it's just a couple. The guests at the Inn were all ages. On Saturday and Sunday they made waffles and they had bagels and muffins. Really good waffles! Everyone was very nice. The only thing was that the Internet was down that weekend, so I wasn't able to use the computer, but it was no problem. In walking distance is a convenience store and gas station. If you want to go for a longer walk, you can reach Ocean Beach and shops. When we got there, we went to Hodad's, which had great hamburgers. Overall, love this hotel a lot! Kind of pricey, but would come back in a second. We are thinking about making this a yearly ritual to go to San Diego and stay at this hotel!","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":2.0,"Check in / front desk":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Miss Autumn Quigley","date":"2014-08-01 22:39:57 +0300"},{"content":"We just got back from this wonderful hotel. We had 4 kids and two adults and loved it. It is brand new and beautiful. We had a two bedroom suite with no kitchen. The shower had double heads, which made it easier to shower more than one child at a time. On the weekends they have a nice breakfast, homemade waffles, muffins, bagels, juices and coffee. There is a computer for your use with no charge. There is also a hotel cat that just adds to the whole ambience. Although you can't get into the ocean from there, it is still a lovely setting. Very quiet and quaint. The hotel staff is very accommodating and friendly. Driving to the hotel, I was questioning where we were going, but once there, it was definitely a fine. I would definitely stay here again.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Christina Howell","date":"2014-06-22 01:28:42 +0300"},{"content":"Splendid Stay! I have stayed in many hotels in SF and this is one my favorites. I got an excellent rate through Priceline. I'm sure I got the cheapest room but it still was quite nice. No view to speak of but everything else was 1st rate. Decent size, comfy King bed, big flat screen TV, robes,Gilchrist toiletries etc. The Hotel is about the most convenient for public transportation you can get with a MUNI/BART stop right at the hotel entrance. The mini fridge didn't work but they fixed it at my request within a couple of hours.Internet is $$$ (16.99 per day) but I managed to get a wireless signal in the room although they say its only free in the lobby. Possibly a higher floor wouldn' get the signal.( I stayed on 3)","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Roberto Walker","date":"2015-06-19 00:21:30 +0300"},{"content":"Nice hotel, small rooms The Mark Hopkins is a lovely hotel in the Nob Hill district. A deluxe room is only about 350 sq. feet, but was clean and comfortable. The staff at the front desk were not overly friendly.If you book through the hotel's website, do like I did and check back often to see if rates come down the closer you get to your check in date. I called the hotel twice for rate reductions when they were offering the same room I booked with significant discounts each time.A visit to the historic Top of the Mark is a must as the views of the city on a clear night are beautiful. One night when my date and I visited the bar at 12:30AM, we were turned away despite a posted closing time of 1:00AM. This was a little frustrating. We found out the next night they wanted to close early to get ready for the brunch crowd the next morning.Overall, a stay at the Mark Hopkins will not disappoint.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Rory Upton","date":"2014-05-07 05:53:25 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Kali Heller","Eliza Schuppe V","Mable Pouros","Crystel Hackett PhD","Parker Medhurst","Adah Considine","Tressie Kris","Verner Schulist"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Located on Shelter Island, this resort offers many activities including [http://www.humphreysconcerts.com/ live concerts].","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":true}
