{"title":"Playa del Rey","name":"The Shack","alt":null,"address":"185 Culver Blvd","directions":null,"phone":"+1-310 823-6222","tollfree":null,"email":null,"url":"http://www.the-shacks.com/","hours":null,"image":null,"price":"Under $10 per person with beverage","content":"While this restaurant now has six locations (two in California, three in Hawaii, and one in Colorado), the Playa del Rey location is the original, opened in 1972.  A surfer bar next to the beach (&quot;Dude food without peer&quot; according to the LA Times), the signature dish is the Shack Burger, a 1/4 pound burger with a Portuguese sausage for $6.50 ($6.25 without cheese).  Order at the counter, hang out in a booth, and enjoy the vibe.  There are also plenty of televisions showing the latest games, and a bar serving the standard American beers (Budweiser, Miller, etc) to help quench your thirst after a day on the waves.  The one downside of this place is that its tiny parking lot fills quickly, and street parking can often be a challenge.","geo":{"lat":33.95872,"lon":-118.44871,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":22539,"country":"United States","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California"}
