The rooms are a good size and clearly very new. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel also has free wifi. It is about a 5 min walk to the metro and it is on 2 metro lines to it's easy to get around from there. The neighbourhood is very quiet though, with not many restaurants or cafÃ©s. If you're looking for a hotel close to nightlife, I would suggest another hotel.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Lucie Hoeger","date":"2012-11-29 21:11:52 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Kody Rutherford DDS","Pauline Senger","Bette Crist","Meagan Welch","Reuben Brekke","Eliza Schaden","Mr. Chris Balistreri"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Sleek, modern boutique hotel just off Union Square.
