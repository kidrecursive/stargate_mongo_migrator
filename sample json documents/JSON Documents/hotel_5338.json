The normal rates for the Wynn or Encore are out of our Las Vegas traveling budget so we were thrilled with the offer. Would I stay again, free or not, probably not? I suppose the pros and cons will intermingle here. The casino décor is really, really red and somewhat gaudy. It is very different from the Wynn or the Bellagio that Steve Wynn built. The room is nice with plenty of space for personal belongings but not as big as it appears on the website. The beds and pillows were comfortable. Although there are outlets by the bed they are taken by the rooms “gadgets” so I just unplugged the lamps. Speaking of gadgets, the control for the curtains is on the bedside table, is not illuminated, so when I wanted to open the curtains in the morning for a just bit of light I had to stumble around with the control and subsequently woke my husband. The honor bar had a variety of choices that I personally found to be exorbitant e.g. 5$ for a 12 oz can of soda and 8$ for a tin of Reese's Pieces. The wifi is included in the 20$ a night resort fee and there was a printer/fax machine in the suite; the fax has a cost to it but I do not know about the printer itself. The bathroom is spacious and the amenities very nice such as shoe polish, cotton balls, q-tips. The shampoo, shower gel etc. was much larger than the standard hotel and is lemon grass fragranced. The towels were very thick and plentiful and there are robes too. There is a ledge that allows plenty of room for personal items without cluttering the counter top. On the down side the bathroom does not have much room to hang anything including a hand towel and the bathtub is short! My husband, who is 6’1 and can stretch out comfortably in our normal size home tub, had to scrunch his knees up in the Encore room tub. I also found it weird that the water controls are on the back not to the side or front of tub. The line at check in wasn’t long and there was plenty of staff but still took longer than it should have in my experience. The staff we encountered were all very courteous and would actually hold/start a conversation. Housekeeping during our stay was excellent everything was put back in order just as the moment we arrived; although with being in a hotel of this caliber right after we checked in I was shocked to find a hairball behind the bathroom door (which was cleaned up the next day). We did use one of the pools at the Encore and had a good time; it was not the one with the bar or the beach club. This pool was easy to access from the elevators just off the casino floor and was a mix of people. We brought in our own drinks in a non-breakable cup they also had ice water readily available throughout the pool area. There were limited shaded areas. Ok after all this rambling why would I not stay there again. I suppose it is all location and incidental costs for me. I felt very disconnected from the rest of the strip; it is an easy walk to the Venetian but not much else. I like to be more centralized where I have more options for gambling and food choices. Perhaps for many who may stay at this property this is not a huge issue but there was nowhere that I found to “grab a quick (inexpensive) bite” or table games less than a 25$ minimum. I have stayed on the strip in a room just as nice , with a great pool, coffee maker, refrigerator and a nicer view for a lot less money.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Sleep Quality":4.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Suzanne Gulgowski","date":"2013-03-22 21:28:30 +0300"},{"content":"The hotel is stunning to look at. Check in was very quick. We arrived after 9pm on a Friday and were offered either the 17th floor strip side or the 37 floor on the quiet side. We chose quiet, the view was high enough that you could avoid looking at the partial construction site and look at the mountains or Wynn golf course. At night we had a view of the city lights, Stratosphere, Circus Circus. Our room looked very much like the website pictures, except that I believe our room was an accessable room. There was not a private toilet room, so having this big giant bathroom was pointless for those of us who like a little privacy. The towels were a bit grungy (looked like someone had mopped up mud with them and it didn't all come out in the wash), hair in the tub, dust on the crooked lamps in the bathroom, hearing neighboring room's noise - is not a five star hotel in my opinion. Details like a second box of kleenex outside of the bathroom, a second set of hooks to hang things in the bathroom (as ours were maybe 3 feet from the floor, and our closet had low shelves, so there was no place to hang anything longer than a shirt) were also missed. The bed was pure comfort. Each morning we went to the adult pool and pressed the button as we left for housekeeping. Our room was always ready when we returned. We ate at several of the casual restaurants for breakfast and lunch. For small meals, the pizza place on the Wynn side was great to grab a slice from (lovely to eat outside by the waterfalls) or the lobby bar at Encore. We tried Stratta before LeReve. The meal was fantastic, but too much food. I must have mentioned when I purchased tickets for LeReve that is was for my husband's birthday; because our server at Stratta brought out a georgeous little dessert cake and candle at the end of our meal. We are not gamblers. We visit Vegas for relaxing, shows, restaurants and shopping. We'd spend a little at the quarter slots before heading to our room each night. The drink service was quick. I enjoyed the wine they served in the casino more than the glass I had at Stratta. We enjoyed our stay at Encore, the casino, pool, restaurants and shops are luxury. I was a bit disappointed with our room; perhaps my expectations were too high, but there were details that they missed. On our next trip it will be a hard decision whether to stay at the Encore or return to the Palazzo (loved the bathroom at Palazzo with the seperate vanity table).","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":4.0},"author":"Vinnie Connelly","date":"2012-05-25 20:04:50 +0300"},{"content":"we stayed from sunday to wednesday.. check in was very efficient and pleasant..apparently we qualified for $100 resort credit which we used for a breakfast buffet one day and a lunch buffet the next day.. (both were excellent!!)..the first day we went to the encore pool (the adult area) and found it to be rather crowded and noisy with lots of loud music not really my taste, and a younger crowd having a great time..that was good for them, but i was really looking for something a little more sedate and relaxing...the next day we found that at the wynn adult pool.. lots of open chairs and much less of a party atmosphere with better (in my opinion ) music..it was a good walk but well worth it..nearby is the fashion mall that has a fairly good selection of fast food for when you dont feel like spending a fortune to eat. the room was really nice and we had a great view at night.. the daytime view was marred a bit by the fact that it squarely overlooked the unfinished casino that was 1/4 built..the shampoos and soaps were really nice and the robes for us was a nice touch too..we brought our own coffee pot as that is not in the room and i didnt feel like going downstairs for a $5 cup of coffee first thing in the morning..really it would be so nice to add a coffee pot in the rooms.. or at least have an option.. i did enjoy the no smoking policy.. all in all a good experience with good service..","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Jules Maggio","date":"2013-12-22 22:34:46 +0300"},{"content":"You haven't done Vegas until you stay at The Encore or the Wynn. I went for a bachelor party with my friends for a weekend and had an awesome time. We've stayed at other resorts before on prevous trips, but this was all about the experience. You don't need to worry about finding the hot spot, because its at either the Wynn or Encore every night. We stayed at The Encore, but it is connected to the Wynn, and from what I could tell the amenities are the same. It is 5 star service all the way. You feel like a celebrity or royalty when you are there. And you will probably see a few while you are there. I highly recommend spending some extra bucks if you are attending the night clubs or pool party and get table service, or a cabana. It is much more enjoyable this way... and hey your in Vegas. For dining, there are many options and all of the restarants are fabulous. My favorite place, and if you are in the mood for a steak, get a reservation at Botero. Get a few side's to share around the table, as these are not your normal side dishes. Get the Mac n Cheese, and trust me this is no box stuff. The staff at the hotel was beyond expectations. The rooms are large, and immaculate. Beds are very comfortable, and when you go home, you are going to want to redo your bathroom to mimic your stay at Encore. I've never spent so much time in the bathroom. If you are doing some gambling don't be shy with your players card. You can talk to the concierge and get some extras with all of your play. This is the best hotel in Vegas, no question. My only regret is I didn't get a spa appointment. I guess I'll have something new to try next time!","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":3.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Meagan Shields","date":"2014-12-18 06:43:46 +0300"},{"content":"Stayed 4 nights at Encore last week, had a fantastic time, great room on the 11th floor facing the north strip, no club noise problems at all. Mini suite layout was lovely and the bathrooms in particular are great. Pool area was excellent, good waitress service, nice laid back atmosphere and really appreciated the adults only pool so you could properly relax with no kids running around! Hotel is beautiful, very bright and airy, I liked that encore was smaller than the Wynn side, it felt much more intimate and laid back. The location is right at the north end of the strip (assuming you dont go up to circus circus - not sure why you would really) but thats not a problem if you dont mind a bit of walking. We also ate at Okada in the Wynn which was fantastic, while I didnt particularly enjoy the Society cafe in the Encore, there wasnt anything wrong as such, just a little slow and a bit dull, not the best breakfast we had in vegas- Peppermill wins on that one! The concierge was fantastic and helped us to check in online for the flights etc, on the whole a fantastic stay, I would definitely reccommend Encore.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Mr. Bettie Orn","date":"2014-09-13 23:54:06 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed in a tower suite at the Wynn Encore in Las Vegas.
