Located in a strip mall next to a barber shop, the painted windows lure you in off the street with 99 cent fish tacos and bean and rice burritos. For a little more you can order a quesadilla (but don’t let the name fool you, quesadillas at Cotija’s are like burritos with cheese). Also tasty are the multiple breakfast burritos, one of which has hash browns — and they’re not limited to breakfast. For true San Diego flavor, try the Shrimp Burrito (also available in the fiery but amazing &quot;Diablo&quot; version). The line to order crowds the dining area as the bars close but there’s nothing like a gut brick to put you to sleep after a long night on the town. And be sure to bring cash because they don’t take plastic.","geo":{"lat":32.798,"lon":-117.25027,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":25225,"country":"United States","city":"San Diego","state":"California"}
