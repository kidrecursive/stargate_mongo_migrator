Parlabane clearly has good taste for a journalist, as the &quot;Cask&quot; is a proper traditional ''boozer'' with a touch of class. Nine Real Ale taps plus a number of draft lagers and many more in bottle. Good range of whisky too. Great place to watch the football or rugby as they have 6 or 7 screens dotted around. It's not uncommon to find 3 different matches being shown at the same time. Refreshingly, the screens are only switched on for specific events, and not left showing random cable channels the rest of the day, like so many pubs seem to do.","geo":{"lat":55.95915,"lon":-3.19034,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":8608,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Edinburgh","state":null}
