The postage stamp collection may be of particular interest to philatelists. There's a tiger skin which was shot in the Saugor area in 1915 together with clothes worn by E.M. Forster when he was secretary to H.H. The Maharajah of Dewas State, Senior. The uniform of Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck is prominently displayed and, quite poignantly considering that the centre of the cotton textile industry has now shifted to [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], the last Union Flag to be lowered at the Residency, [[Lucknow]] in 1947 is exhibited.","geo":{"lat":53.83969,"lon":-2.200406,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":36150,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Nelson","state":null}
