Excellent value. Our room was a little small but clean and quiet. We shared a bathroom down the hall but never ever saw one other person on the floor, so never had to wait. Good breakfast too. And the location is ideal. Stay here.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Christian Morar","date":"2012-01-08 01:34:18 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Anabel Ullrich DVM","Miss Maximo Streich","Mrs. Muriel Stoltenberg","Mrs. Pierce Bednar","Laurine Ward","Brando McLaughlin MD","Gloria Lakin","Concepcion Hegmann"],"vacancy":false,"description":"A New England style beach house, located three blocks from the Pacific ocean and five minutes from Los Angeles International Airport.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":true}
