They carry a varied selection of cakes, pies, and breads, including Irish soda bread. The pies are made with Irish-style pie crust and are most definitely worth a try. The proprietor uses traditional recipes passed down through her family, and if she's not too busy you may get some family history with your cake. The coffee is pretty good too. They update Twitter and Facebook regularly with daily specials.","geo":{"lat":32.79932,"lon":-117.24397,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":25233,"country":"United States","city":"San Diego","state":"California"}
