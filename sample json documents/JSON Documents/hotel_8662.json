We had a booked a superior double and when we arrived we were told we'd been upgraded. The room was fairly large by Paris standards and had a day bed, which I assume could sleep a 3rd person/child. The bathroom was really modern and had a bath and large separate shower with large overhead shower head, plus hand held shower. All the decor was tasteful and we were at the back of the hotel overlooking the small courtyard garden, so very quiet, although the hotel is on a quiet street anyway. Short walk to the Jardin du Luxembourg and less that 5 mins to a metro, which was on a direct line to the Gare du Nord, so perfect for us as we took the Eurostar from London. Hotel booked us a table at a great restaurant, superb food, which they recommended. Breakfast was served to order and you got croissants, pain au chocolat, bread and could choose omelettes etc. The fruit salad was freshly made, the yoghurts were the posh ones in glass jars. Would really recommend the hotel, but not for small children - there are a lot of carefully placed vases and objets d'art that little fingers will want to touch...","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Brittany Ledner Jr.","date":"2012-06-21 07:48:16 +0300"},{"content":"I spent a wonderful week at the Villa Madame, finding the staff very helpful and gracious. My 5th floor room was very clean and light, quiet, and comfortable. The hotel is extremely well located only a few short blocks to the metro, Jardins du Luxemburg, and shopping. The hotel offered free wifi, and much more surprisingly, free international telephone service from my room via voip. Breakfasts were excellent, and the garden area was quiet and comfortable. Just around the corner is Maison du Jardin, a very excellent small restaurant with prix fixe 31 euro dinners. Staff made other great recommendations as well. I would unhesitatingly recommend and will return.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Lauren Ortiz","date":"2014-10-01 14:04:03 +0300"},{"content":"My friend and I were backbacking through London and Paris and decided to splurge a little on this hotel. It turned out amazing. You really don't want to risk a hostel in Paris, they are serious dumps. I did a hostel in Paris in 2007. I picked this hotel due to it's proximity to nightlife in the Latin Quarter and it looked nice. The bathroom had a walk in shower with glass door. Flatscreen TV had an aux speaker in the bathroom to hear the tv while doing your thing. Beds were very comfortable and the room we got was big and facing the street. The street was loud during mid afternoon due to the Catholic school playground down the block. We booked a room with two singles and when we went to check in we were told they had inadvertantly given our room away. I started to freak because I was sure we would get a fast one pulled as usually happens in western europe. We were happy that after my face of death look we were upgraded to a larger room with two double beds. Unfortunately for the poor lady who had booked the room they bumped her and I don't know where she was then moved. Overall the staff was slow on check'in. Breakfast was carbs and coffee. They have a person dedicated only to breakfast and coffee however it seems odd because this is a very small hotel. We were the youngest guests in the hotel by about 50 years. Everyone else looked like they were late fifties to mid seventee's. We are single thirtysomethings. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a peacefull nights sleep in Paris.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":2.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":4.0},"author":"Turner Ferry","date":"2013-11-29 14:38:35 +0300"},{"content":"The Villa Madame is a lovely, comfortable, well-located boutique hotel with excellent service. My wife and I enjoyed our stay there immensely. This hotel is chic and luxuriously comfortable especially for the price. Admittedly, the room we had (Classic Double Room) was the smallest hotel room my wife and I had ever seen at about 3m x 3.5m (10' x 12'). The large outdoor terrace, fantastic bathroom (with HermÃ¨s products and great water pressure), deliciously comfortable bed, iPod docking station, super-fast free wi-fi and excellent service more than made up for the tiny room. Alex at the front desk was a delight as she answered our every question and was always happy to chat and share information. The location is excellent being only a few minutes walk from either the Rennes or St-Sulpice Metro stops, 100m from the beautiful Jardin du Luxembourg and within easy walking distance of the myriad of shops and restaurants on both the Rue de Rennes and Boulevard Saint-Germain. The hotel serves a decent continental breakfast which seems expensive at 18â‚¬ but we found a package that was below the normal rate and included breakfast. The breakfast room, as other reviewers have noted, is small and has only four tables for two. All of the tables were occupied each time we went for breakfast but the hotel happily served us as we sat in the little lounge area so it wasn't ever a problem. They don't serve lunch or dinner but there are two brasseries within 50m of the front door and many more restaurants and coffee shops just a few blocks away. There were a few other minor concerns that I had regarding this hotel: - The minibar is stocked only with two bottles of water. It would be nice if there was a limited selection of other beverages and also a kettle for tea/coffee service. - The satellite television has almost 900 channels (yes, I went through them all late one night) but half of them are Arabic and almost all of the rest are in French save for one German language station, a couple of Italian stations and only Bloomberg for the English speakers. Although one doesn't go to Paris to watch TV in the room, it's nice to relax and watch the news or a movie after a long day on the town but unless the above suits you, you won't have much cause to even turn on the set. - The street is very small and it is very difficult to find parking. This is likely not a problem for most visitors but is something to keep in mind especially if you rent a car. Overall, my wife and I loved this hotel. The few cons are heavily outweighed by the comforts we enjoyed. We are very seasoned travelers and despite the tiny room, this hotel experience was one of our best ever. We will definitely stay at the Villa Madame again.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Blaze Williamson","date":"2014-04-26 13:59:54 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Madelynn Littel","Marielle Daugherty","Micah Stiedemann","Sandra Howe","Angela Oga"],"vacancy":true,"description":"21 Festival Square.
