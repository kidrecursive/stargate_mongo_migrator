Have a good breakfast, store our shopping bags, get ready for a night out and sleep. Everything about this hotel was excellent. If you want a perfect hotel with a perfect location down town THIS is it. The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated. The breakfast was more than enough. The staff was very friendly and the cherry on the sundae was the roof terrace.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Dashawn Pollich","date":"2015-06-24 13:02:41 +0300"},{"content":"I am not sure about this hotel. We wanted to stay in the Lower East side so our pool of hotels to choose from I guess was limited. We decided to book this hotel for 5 nights based on reviews, the hotel website and location. We stayed for 2 nights and ended up moving to Hotel Rivington around the corner. I guess the main problem was that we were into the last week of a 3 week trip around Canada and had stayed in some lovely hotels and maybe were quite spoilt. The main issue is the size of the rooms. We booked a room with 2 single beds and I believe these rooms are slightly bigger then the double rooms however they are still really, really small. Also, the rooms are quite dark and lack any real style. I had looked at the hotel website and was aware that the twin rooms had a brown/cream decor but they really are quite dull. I noticed that all rooms on this particular floor were the same regardless of bedding type. I looked at a room with a double bed that was being cleaned and it was similar but even smaller. I assume other floors have rooms with brighter decors per the hotel website. The room was very clean as was the bathroom so if you just want a bed to sleep in and don't care about decor then it is more than adequate. I was not desperate to leave but just knew that The Hotel Rivington was in a similar position, had offered me a slightly cheaper rate, rooms would be bigger and decor more stylish. The major plus of Hotel East Houston is the location if you are interested in the lower east side and the rooftop. We really enjoyed taking our breakfast up to the rooftop on trays provided and eating in front of the New York skyline. It is also within walking distance of NoLita (loved Elizabeth Street) and Soho etc... When we moved to Hotel Rivington, we were a lot happier. The room was almost twice the size, very funky in decor, had a small lounge area with couch and coffee table, a whole wall of wardrobes, automated blinds that you opened from your bed which provided a nice view of the New York skyline, a great bathroom which was grey and silver with double shower and japanese tub and every night there was a turndown service with a different type of sweet example brownies. Although the room rate did not include breakfast like Hotel East Houston, it was $10 cheaper. Hotel East Houston was just not right for us. It is not a bad hotel by any means and I probably would have stayed the whole 5 nights if I was not aware of The Rivington.","ratings":{"Overall":3.0},"author":"Abagail Quitzon","date":"2012-12-08 12:58:50 +0300"},{"content":"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights on a pre xmas shopping break in November 2009 and found it to be a really good choice, the rooms are very small as per some of the other reviews, and as a result storage space is practically nil, and the free WiFi isn't really worth bothering with because it keeps dropping out. However they are the only negatives of the hotel, the location is great for access to Soho, Noho & Greenwich village on foot, while the uptown madness is also only a short ride away on the F V subway line or by foot also. I noted one of the other reviewers complained about the price, saying he was paying near Â£250 a night, I'd also be insensed if I was paying that much but we picked the East Houston for economy and location, paying only Â£130 a night and to that end we feel we got what we paid for. Rooms are clean and the shower room, while having one glass wall which isn't ideal, is a reasonable size. Decor is attractive while being unremarkable, in the flock wall papered style favoured by 'boutique' hotel proprietors. There is an iPod docking stereo in the bedroom and bulgari toileteries in the bathroom. Most importantly the room was clean and the the bed comfortable, even if you may be disturbed by the traffic and street life outside, but you'd have to expect that from a city that never sleeps.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":3.0,"Location":4.0,"Rooms":3.0},"author":"Jammie Morar","date":"2012-07-18 18:49:56 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Kenny Ortiz","Nathen Larkin","Mallory Hackett","Mr. Aylin Ritchie","Ena Ferry","Marco Will IV","Rachel Prosacco"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Affordable hotel accommodations with comfortable, clean rooms.","alias":null,"pets_ok":false,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
