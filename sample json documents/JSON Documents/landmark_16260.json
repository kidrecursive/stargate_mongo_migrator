From 1846 onwards, the arch was topped with a massive equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington - a major road widening of Piccadilly in 1882 was the opportunity to finally remove the over sized statue to [[Aldershot]]. The present magnificent statue ''Peace Descending on the Quadriga of War'' was placed on top of the Arch in 1912, and remains today the largest bronze sculpture in the [[United Kingdom]], spectacularly lit at night. During the 1950s, the arch served as the smallest police station in the city, when it was occupied by ten constables, two sergeants and a cat! The arch was opened to the public for the first time in April 2001 after a £1.5 million restoration by English Heritage. (Wellington Arch is also available for corporate and private events - with dramatic views down Constitution Hill and across central London from the Arch's spacious balconies, Wellington Arch is a novel and unique place to impress your guests).","geo":{"lat":51.5025,"lon":-0.1508,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":16260,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"London","state":null}
