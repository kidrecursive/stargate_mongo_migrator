Until 1832 Old Sarum was a 'rotten borough', electing two members of parliament despite long periods during which there were no residents. Most of the site is free to enter, although there is a charge to enter the Inner Bailey.","geo":{"lat":51.091939,"lon":-1.801509,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"see","type":"landmark","id":24883,"country":"United Kingdom","city":"Salisbury","state":null}
