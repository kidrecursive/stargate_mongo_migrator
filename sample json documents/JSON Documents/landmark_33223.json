The West Hollywood outpost features a 50-seat outdoor patio that is nice for soaking up the sun and people watching. Inside it’s tabletop jukeboxes, classic movie photos on the wall, ‘50s tune blaring through the stereo and, most important, great diner food; the famous ‘Melburger,’ chili fries, milk shakes and really just about everything else. It’s one of those Los Angeles places locals and tourists alike flock to. Formerly &quot;Ben Franks&quot; (mentionrd by Frank Zappa, among others), it's long been one of the most famous spots in the city, as far as restaurants go.","geo":{"lat":34.0929,"lon":-118.379191,"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"activity":"eat","type":"landmark","id":33223,"country":"United States","city":"West Hollywood","state":"California"}
