Awesome tapas. The &quot;Queso Fundido&quot; is wicked and it packs enough calories to keep you dancing until 4AM. Audio and video feeds of live DJs are streamed in to work around current license restrictions. This place is fun when it's packed and when it's empty.","geo":{"lat":37.7578,"lon":-122.4094,"accuracy":"ROOFTOP"},"activity":"drink","type":"landmark","id":25906,"country":"United States","city":"San Francisco","state":"California"}
