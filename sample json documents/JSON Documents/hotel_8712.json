We definitely recommend the Coventry.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Myrtie Gusikowski","date":"2015-06-06 17:35:51 +0300"},{"content":"Clean, Comfortable and Convenient We recently spent a weekend at the Coventry and found it a very satisfactory experience. We did have a room in the back away from the traffic of Lombard Street so noise was not a problem. The housekeeping staff was very friendly and did a wonderful job keeping things clean. The location is very convenient for getting places by car, foot or public transportation. There are plenty of good restaurants within walking distance.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Business service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Mr. Isaac Ward","date":"2013-11-01 13:54:50 +0300"},{"content":"What A Stay In The City By The Bay! I stayed at this motor inn for one week in october I booked two queen beds, the room we had was facing buchanan street at the side of the building on the third floor the room was huge with two queen beds which would have slept three people easily on each bed. there was a table with three chairs, sofa, and a refrigerator and the bathroom was also very roomy, this room was just an incredible value for the money not to mention the free wireless internet access , free local phone calls and the most important thing the free parking we used our car to drive up and down the crooked street, muir woods and over the golden gate bridge into sausalito and other side trips dont forget to make reservations at spinnakers in sausalito the view was absolutely unbelieveable.we also purchased a seven day muni passport. the #30 stockton will get you to chinatown, northbeach, union square, and ghiradelli square where you can delight in the best hot fudge sundae I have ever tasted.I got one of the best feelings jumping off a cable car before it even stopped.you must use your key to get to the elevator which made us feel very secure,special thanks to sherman at the front desk for outstanding customer service and providing great directions there was some street noise at night but not enought to keep us awake I sleeped liked a baby.Im so glad I decided to go this route instead of staying in one of those cramped hotel rooms in union square with no car or a $40 a day charge to park my car thanks coventry motor inn for making my trip to sanfrancisco unforgetable .......","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Jordi Kirlin","date":"2015-10-29 09:34:29 +0300"},{"content":"Perfect For Our City Honeymoon! My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and it was wonderful! The bed was comfortable, the room was very clean, and the staff was very, very nice. We had a fridge in our room for a very small charge which was good for keeping breakfast and snacks cold. There is a family owned market across the street open 24/7 for anything you might need. The hotel is within walking distance of two major shopping areas (Chestnut St. and Union St.) and there is a bus stop one block away. Perfect!

This was a great deal for San Francisco. I requested an interior room because I was afraid of the street noise. It was very very quiet, I don't know how the exterior rooms would be, but the interior was very quiet. Obviously no view when you look out the window, I looked at a cement wall, but it did let in light and air. I was able to close the curtains and make the room very dark to sleep. The room was a bit cramped, but not horrible. It was very clean. The staff was very nice and helpful with advice. The parking was free, which is a rarity. Self-park, which is nice for budget-travelers because of no tipping.","ratings":{"Service":-1.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":-1.0,"Check in / front desk":-1.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":-1.0,"Rooms":-1.0,"Location":-1.0},"author":"Ayden Wehner Sr.","date":"2014-11-15 00:26:39 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Clara Schmidt","Ali Graham","Brenden Bode","Darien Thompson","Lucie Bailey","Carroll Grady","Mrs. Philip Sawayn","Korey Mitchell"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Not the most inspiring of locations, but very convenient adjacent to the City Bypass for road trips around the rest of Scotland and right next to Edinburgh Park Station for speedy transport to the city centre.
