My check in was quick- and since it was a slow week they even were able to check us in early! The staff was pleasant and the check in process was smooth. Our room was just as it looks in the picture. I like the warm colors and decorative pictures. Housekeeping was always thorough & clean- it was a great week! For the price you can't beat this place. Its so close to the Disney parks! Another great feature is the playground and gated pool, its a great place to let the kids run free. I really enjoyed my stay and will return again hopefully soon.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Jaquelin Roberts","date":"2012-06-14 08:42:09 +0300"},{"content":"This is my favorite hotel in Kissimmee.
