This was my second trip to New Orleans and the best expierence ever. The room I had was a little cramped, but it was clean and the bed was comfortable. I was very relaxed and enjoyed the quiet, compared to staying exactly in the French Quarter. Everything you wanted to see was walking distance or you could have taken the trolley closer to town. Whenever I have the chance to return I will DEFINATELY consider staying here again. Thank you to everyone at the Avenue Garden Hotel for such a wonderful experience and great memories!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Alvina Abbott MD","date":"2013-07-02 14:32:55 +0300"},{"content":"4 of us stayed here for the Cardinalâ€™s/Saintâ€™s game. As frequent visitors to NOLA, we decided to try something other than the 'Quarter. We recalled this gem from a stay last year. It is located in a former home, with whimsical detail to its dÃ©cor. Our rooms were nice size, clean & comfortable. Not large by 'chain' standards but certainly accommodating. Sorta feels like a nice B & B. No nightclubs nearby but Vieux Carreâ€™ is a 10 minute, $8 cab ride away. We were more interested in a little charm with lot less noise and no crowds in the street. Magazine St. with its shops is nearby. Plenty of nice restaurants, funky bars on this end of town plust ability for a morning run or â€˜chubby walkâ€™ down St. Charles. We appreciated the morning coffee, juices & light breakfast too. We recommend this if someone wants to try something other than the â€˜Quarter. Cool place, nice & gracious staff. Lotta bang for the buck.","ratings":{"Overall":4.0},"author":"Deonte O'Reilly","date":"2012-12-26 21:19:54 +0300"},{"content":"This hotel was cozy, conveniently located and allowed you to feel as a resident for a stay, instead of just a hotel guest. The private entrances, charming courtyard and extremely friendly staff can't be beat. The trolley car picks you up right in front of the hotel, and is wonderful for heading out into the Garden District to see the history and architecture, or to take you to the French Quarter for some serious partying. If you are going to New Orleans, definately stay here!!!","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Carmella O'Keefe","date":"2012-06-09 20:29:38 +0300"},{"content":"I love, love, love, love, love this hotel. My stay here was fantastic. Lydia, the manager (owner? not sure) is as sweet and helpful as she can be, and hotel staff are kind and always ready to help with anything. The location on St. Charles means a $6 cab ride to the French Quarter in one direction and Uptown in the other. This means you're not far from the party, but when you've had enough you're a cheap cab ride to your quiet hotel room. Also, the location means hailing a cab at most hours of the day/night is super easy. The room was spotless, the bed was comfortable, the patio was precious. Stay here! You won't regret it. The price is so good I'd even call it underpriced. Highly, highly recommended!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Location":5.0,"Rooms":5.0},"author":"Cloyd Skiles","date":"2014-08-14 19:00:27 +0300"},{"content":"Great value, wonderful location, charming accomodations, good security, BEST STAFF ever.

My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary and loved it. We booked on the website last minute and got a great rate. The staff was wonderful and very helpful. They offer off street parking for $10 a day, which is very affordable and recommended. The location was perfect ~ right on the trolley line. There are several local restaurants and bars that are very close and very affordable. The rooms are like an old boarding house and very romantic. The court yard is great for just chilling with a few drinks and friends. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a try New Orleans experience at a great price and location.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Garfield Mante","date":"2012-05-20 09:09:04 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Christy Okuneva","Kathleen Skiles Sr.","Geoffrey Glover"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Set in the centre of town, this hotel makes an ideal base for a visit to  the area.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
