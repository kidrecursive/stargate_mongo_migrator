First let's start with the good: Rooms were in little houses of 4 rooms per bungalow, which meant privacy. The minibar and minifrige were pretty nice, which included an array of different liquors. The staff was all really nice and helpful with an exception. My room did not smell like other people's expierience. The pools were nice too. They had little shops and a really cool club that plays a mixture of music. Now the bad. The front desk staff were the exception to the nice staff. They were completely unorganized and rude. The rooms don't use key cards, just keys. If you charge anything to your room be prepared to pay cash. THEY DON'T EXCEPT CREDITCARDS!!! The minibar and frige are stocked every other day. The worst of all, I had to hike to get to the pool, the front desk, and the beach. Some are closer and some are not, like mine was. The whole area is like a maze, YOU WILL GET LOST, all the houses look the same, take the map, that is given to you. Overall I would rate this hotel 2-3 out of 5 stars. Like my title states, I've had better....","ratings":{"Service":3.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Check in / front desk":1.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":2.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":3.0},"author":"Ewell Funk","date":"2012-07-13 20:04:23 +0300"},{"content":"Location, location, location!!! My husband and I just returned from a week stay at the Riu Taino and we were very very pleased. Reception: We checked in within minutes and after nicely asking Joanna (who was extremley helpful) to be put in a room closest to the beach, she did it with no problem and no extra charge. Jose was a young, funny, and helpful young man who worked the front desk and who helped me many many times during our week stay. He gave us an umbrella after we lost ours for no charge, a converter for my hair straightner and battery chargers and such, also for no charge. The front desk staff was excellent to myself and my husband. Upon arrival we were given ice cold fruit punch and were escorted to our room (it was quite late out).The Rooms: They were clean, well lit and comfortable. We had 3 beds in which one we used for shopping and extra storage space. The safe was at no charge and I did not find any problems with it. We felt safe and comfortable leaving over $4000 US in there, including ipods, cameras, cell phones etc. The shower pressure was great and even at the busy times we never ran out of hot water. The mini was a bonus!!!! Rum, rye, vodka and gin were stocked every second day, including many different kinds of pop and a large jug of water. The AC worked very well and we often found it a litlle chilly (still not complaing!)The Food, Bars and Service: Excellent. For those that like the ala cart meals, you can book as many as you like between the hours of 7 and 10 am. We ate ala cart 4 times in a week and were very pleased. The staff was AMAZING!!!! We spent most of our time in the little Coco's bar. The drinks were made of good quality booze and they offered a martini menu after 6pm. Victor, Abel and Carlitos were the main bartenders there, they made sure that we were ALWAYS looked after. They truly made our stay that much more special.All in all, the Riu Taino was a $@!#% of a deal for the treatment that we recieved. The resort is small enough that you are never more than 10 minutes from the beach, yet big enough that even after a week we still had lots to do. The pools were clean and water sports were included. If you do not walk into their country with your head up your $@!#% and demand and boss them around, you will be treated like a princess. I was at least :)","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Pauline Lubowitz","date":"2014-09-01 05:16:44 +0300"},{"content":"Riu Taino good value       Beachfront of the Riu Taino","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":2.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Gianni Corkery","date":"2013-08-09 01:29:58 +0300"},{"content":"Cant Wait to go back to TAINO!! My wife and i just returned from 7 days at the Riu Taino and had a Great time! We dont have any complaints and will defiently go back again!!We arived at aprox 20:30 so it was dark and there was a Street party that they have every thrusday going on out side our hotel so we had to be droped off at the Riu Naiboa. We were then walked to the Taino with Hotel employees bringing our bags. Check in was Fast only 2 mins and we were taken to our Bungalow! One point the rooms at the Taino have a Main power Switch as soon as you come in the door it is on the Right side it turns off all power to the room lights, tv, clock everything. (caught us off gaurd walked back and was told how to turn it on) Room was decent not amazing but suits the purpose. Tv worked and even had a few English Channels!Beach was Amazing nice blue water! warm and very enjoyable! Always found 2 chairs to sit on even after an excursion getting back at 13:00 there were still chairs! Pool was Nice and pool bar was good! A little harder to get chairs at the pool usaly by 8:30 they were all reserved (good old towel game) Staff were Fantasitc and very very friendly Wilken in the main buffet was great and always helpfull! Buffet were good never had a problem finding somthing to eat we are not pickey eaters but there should never be a problem finding food!! We ate at 2 of the dinners we ate at the Mexican wich was GREAT, food was fresh tastey and HOT! the second one we tried was the Steak house.. Out of my 7 days there this was my only complaint with the hole trip!! the prepared dinner here was just plain BAD all of it the steaks were really bad i had chicken that wasnt cooked the vegies were either WAY passed cooked or just bad!! i would not let this ruin my night so we just went to the buffet and filled up on Great food!Tips: Tips are included in your stay but that doesnt mean you shouldnt Tip its apreciated and sometimes it gets you the little extra. We tiped our Maid $2 every day and also put out little gifts for her also every day. Our Fridge was stocked every day and i left a not asking for more Brama beer and Pepesi and they were restocked every day! i left them a $2 tip also with usaly a pack of Gum!! We tried to sit in the same area in the Buffet for our meals so we could use the same people and when we recevied good service we tiped!!Excursions- we chose 2 excusions we went on the Carribien Festivle and Tropical Storm. in our opinion the Tropical storm was way better. it was alot of fun and every one enjoyed themselfs turned out to be a major Party and alot of drinkin and alot of Dancing what a great Time staf on the boat was Awsome and Capt Jose was a great Guy... when we were done this cruise we wanted to book it again it was that good and that much FUN!!!Carrabien Festivle was Fun alot more relaxed alot more Family Orientated and getting to see the Nurse Sharks and hold the Manta Rays was really neat Also.. was a little Rushed at the sharks and rays and wasnt as much Fun as Tropical storm but still nice!!hints of what to take... we didnt see ANY bugs at all.. my best advice would be to take a Thermal mug i took a 30oz and my wife took a 20oz and the bartenders had no problem filling them up for us.. Worked great.. Also bring gifts for the locals or employees its a nice thought!Our Sunquest Rep Jorge was Awsome great help and easy to talk to he help make things great for use!Anyways My Wife and i are looking forword to Returning to this Hotel again SOON we would recomend it to Anyone that wants to have a great time and relax.. if you have any questions just ask!Adanac00 and wife!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Check in / front desk":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Nash Koepp V","date":"2013-05-11 06:46:05 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Chester Lehner","Carroll Greenholt","Madge Tromp","Mr. Courtney Leannon","Chaim Stehr III"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Offers central London accommodation from grand suites to individually decorated bedrooms near the shops of Oxford Street and Bond Street and local attractions.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
