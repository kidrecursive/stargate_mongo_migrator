Yes, we are part of history, Airline history. April 7th to 14th in a free condo and ATA Airlines went under. So, we thought of Calistoga and the Roman Spa. The Roman Spa is the only place we ever stay, coming almost every year when we can. We love the proximity to Main St. and all the restuarants and shopping. We absoutly love the lush and beautiful gardens the pools and piece and Quite.
