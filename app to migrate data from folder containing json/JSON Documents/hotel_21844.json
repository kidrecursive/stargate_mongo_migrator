The hotel rooms on the upper floors are much nicer than the ones on the ground level floors (1 and 2). There can be slight problems with the toilets and ants on the first two floors, so request a room on the upper level. I would give this hotel a harsher review, however, ants seem to be the order of the day at most of the lodgings in Kihei on the ground levels. The room decor is very nice and the suites are extremely spacious. The hotel lobby, pool and jacuzzi area and on-site restaurant are very nice. The hotel is centrally located to the beaches, shopping and dining which were a major plus, not to mention there's free internet access if you must stay connected. Call the hotel directly and negotiate a rate which is what we did and I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay (upper floors :-) for the bargin price I got...","ratings":{"Overall":4.0},"author":"Katlynn McGlynn","date":"2012-01-29 08:37:13 +0300"},{"content":"Very clean rooms in a great location.

Good location, right across from the beach and about a 12 minute walk to lot's of restaurants and bars. Free laundry on site too!!! Poolside bar closes by 9:30PM, only drawback but only a small thing. Very nice overall.","ratings":{"Overall":4.0},"author":"Jarod Lind","date":"2015-09-17 16:44:05 +0300"},{"content":"Just returned from 2 nights at this hotel, it was ok for the price of $167 a night, but we had \"crawling bugs\" in our room. Parking was free, but very difficult to find a spot if you returned in the evening. A/C was very noisy, it was quieter if you left the door open for the night. Check out Life's a Beach and Kahale's for some local flair.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3.0,"Overall":2.0,"Value":3.0,"Service":2.0,"Rooms":2.0},"author":"Oda Kuvalis","date":"2014-12-23 06:38:22 +0300"},{"content":"This was one of the nicest resorts we ever stayed at, located near the end of the road just south of Wailea. Your first view of the resort is a wonderfully spacious lobby, and a beautiful atrium garden with waterfalls, ponds and luscious tropical plants. Extremely friendly personnel make your check-in a breeze. The fact that we were upgraded to an ocean view made it even more special. The large rooms are everything you expect from a first class resort. The resortâ€™s biggest amenity is its location. The beautiful beach is the envy of south Maui. Most snorkel trips travel to this beach because of the great abundance of sea creatures, including octopi, turtles and eels. Truly some of the best snorkeling Iâ€™ve personally ever enjoyed. The pool is simple but very inviting, and the waitstaff will take care of everything you need. We enjoyed the Friday night seafood buffet, and the chef personally cut select sushi for us. The golf course offers some of the best views of Molokini on the island, and was a joy to play. We enjoyed a couple of drinks and a wonderful sunset at the â€œCafÃ© on the Greenâ€� after golf. It doesnâ€™t get any better than this. Everyone at this resort was so nice. We will return.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Mertie Wiza","date":"2014-07-31 22:43:34 +0300"},{"content":"We stayed at the Makena Beach and Golf Resort from February 13th to the 20th and had a fabulous time. Previously we had stayed at this resort when it was the Maui Prince and while we loved the location it was in need of some upkeep. When we were able to stay again on this trip we were so excited to see what had been done. The hotel and grounds have definately seen improvements. There seems to be more staff and the service was friendly and consistant. We were greeted each day, from the front desk staff, the breakfast servers and the gardeners with a big smile and an Aloha. The breakfast buffet that was included in our room rate was superb. From made to order omlettes, fresh fruit and waffles and pancakes there was something for everyone. The beach is what keeps bringing us back. Even though the hotel was full the beach was never crowded. My husband and daughter were able to swim out to Turtle Town right from the front of the hotel. The nice surprise this time was the added activities that were available to guests with a variety each day. We went to the \"Night Under The Stars\" and found the whole experience a lot of fun. Becky was informative, entertaining and enthusiastic. Whether you are a couple or a family there is something for everyone. The location was perfect and the fire and smores just added to the experience. We have only been home for two days and we are already talking about when we can return. My only hope is that with all the improvements to the property they do not raise the rates to the point that we can no longer afford to stay here. This is truly our dream vacation spot.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Alaina Kassulke","date":"2014-02-03 04:26:02 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Kasandra Dietrich","Vanessa Ondricka","Dr. Shane Goodwin","Ms. Ivory Muller","Randi Flatley","Hayley Collier"],"vacancy":true,"description":"4-star hotel on a quiet street.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":false,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
