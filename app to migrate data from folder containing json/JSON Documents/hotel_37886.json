We booked through an online booking site and were initially worried about the reception we would receive but all of our concerns quickly disappeared. The staff at the hotel were outstanding in every way. They consistently excelled in their service and their attention to any needs we may have had. The complimentary car is a fabulous amenity and was greatly utilized and appreciated during our stay. We stayed in one of the suites and found the room to be perfect for our needs as we had 3 adults and a toddler. Our suite had 2 queen beds and a living room area with a pull out couch and a second standard couch. The living room had a large flat screen tv and the bedroom area had a smaller flat screen tv. The hotel is very nice in and of itself but the staff is really what makes this place shine. I cant recommend it enough and would definitely stay there again.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Tremaine Wilkinson","date":"2014-09-21 21:31:01 +0300"},{"content":"I was blown away by the small touches the Sorrento had in the rooms and in the main areas. From menus from the 1920s to french presses and ground coffee in the rooms, the Sorrento has that modern but historic feel. Plus its in a great location and easy to get in and around Seattle.","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":4.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Darron Friesen","date":"2013-07-14 02:32:52 +0300"},{"content":"I stayed at this hotel for three nights last weekend. The staff, outstanding and extremely accomodating. The rooms, comfortable and full of style. The feeling and energy, amazing. Somehow despite having all the modcons you could want to keep you happy, the hotel has retained its original look and feel inside (think early 1900's glamour), and maintained it from the rooms to the public areas.... and the resulting energy is excellent and a far cry from modern, cookie cutter hotels. My only hesitation and the reason why I did not give this a 5 is because they need another elevator when things get busy. (I wanted to give a 4.5 but didn't have that option). Highly recommended for business or pleasure, I will be back.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Miss Jaeden Grimes","date":"2012-09-15 04:45:25 +0300"},{"content":"My apologies for not writing this sooner! My husband and I had a wonderful stay at this hotel last spring for our anniversary and wanted to be sure to tell you what an amazing time we had. My husband planned the entire thing without my knowledge so thank you the staff for helping him make it perfect for both of us! The hotel property itself is stunning and welcomes you immediately. We booked the \"shaken and stirred\" package which included a full breakfast in the Hunt Club restaurant (on-site) and in-room martinis. We highly recommend this package if it's still available. All I can say is WOW! Everything about our stay went perfectly from the valet greeting us all the way through our check-out and even included a call to our room a few minutes after arrival to ensure everything was perfect. They clearly understand what customer service means and they made us feel like nothing would be a problem if we asked. MARTINIS: We didn't know what to expect in the way of martini fixings in the room but we were pleasantly surprised. They supplied everything you need to make the martinis: martini glasses, lemon, zester, olives, toothpicks, shaker, ice and a nice bottle of SKY Vodka (enough for 2 drinks each). They also included a nice note to wish us a happy anniversary (nice touch). ROOM SVC: We really enjoyed our in room dining. The food was amazing and arrived sooner than expected since the hotel/restaurant were extremely busy that night. THE ROOM: The bed and linens were luxurious! You won't be ready to leave them in the morning...I promise :)! The bathroom was a little small - wished they would have had a soaking tub at least. We were in a standard room so they might have them in the suites...maybe next time :). We did not ask for an upgrade but somehow I think they would have done it if they had the availability at the time. BREAKFAST: The food in the Hunt Club was delicious and plentiful. My husband had the french toast (which could feed 3 people) and I had the quiche which also could feed 2-3 people. Our waitress was very helpful and very attentive (although not overly so). We have no hesitation about recommending this place for anyone who needs a little time away at an affordable price. You'll feel like you must have spent a fortune here when you leave because of the beauty of the property and the atmosphere you're in. However, you'll feel anything but poor when you leave this luxury hotel...truly refreshing! The service at this hotel once again gave me reason to believe that there are a few great hotels still out there that believe that \"hospitality\" really does mean being hospitable and accommodating to your guests. We never felt like an inconvenience to anyone and our money wasn't your first concern. Well done! It's been a difficult year for us (and lots of other folks) financially but if we can afford it we'll be back to celebrate again in February (maybe a suite this time). Thanks again for an amazing experience!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Cassandre Hodkiewicz","date":"2014-12-29 10:16:05 +0300"},{"content":"This is a true find in any city!

The room was wonderful, the staff was very helpful, our free ride to and from the Space Needle for dinner.... It was lovely. And I love that they change the carpet in the elevator every day!

The hotel was charming, the staff very efficient and made us feel most welcome. Loved the older type hotel, had a charming ambiance, nice break from big chain hotels. Location is good, short walk to waterfront, plenty of cafes nearby to get espresso, speaking of coffe they had french press in room to make coffee which was a very nice touch. We valeted our car at the hotel, it is more than the public parking garages but not by much and when you consider you have access to your car 24/7 worth the extra money, valets were qucik and very nice. We did not dine at the hotel, but I did use the gym which was good for a hotel. Part of my visit I choose to just stay in the room rather than walk around city because I found it so comfortable and appealling. Usuually do not do reviews, but thought this hotel deserved it. Both my husband and I would look forward to staying there again.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Service":5.0},"author":"Enola Hickle","date":"2014-07-15 09:48:03 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Ms. Ottilie Moore","Mitchel Larkin","Montana Franecki"],"vacancy":false,"description":"Offers free 24-hour shuttle service.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":false,"free_parking":true}
