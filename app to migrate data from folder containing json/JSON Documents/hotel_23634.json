Great location, very clean, nice pool area, would recommend for those who want to save some money and don't require all the frills!! Only pet peeve is they charge extra for EVERYTHING!! $1.00 for local calls, $3.14 charge to use the in room safe daily, $4.95 an hour to use business centre computer, charge to use in-room internet. If all of these things are important to you daily, stay elsewhere! But if you don't care to make phone calls or use the internet, this is the place to stay! You could look at this as a way to get away from it all... by charging you for it! Staff very friendly and helpful!","ratings":{"Service":4.0,"Business service":3.0,"Cleanliness":4.0,"Check in / front desk":3.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":3.0,"Location":4.0},"author":"Joanie Fritsch","date":"2013-10-01 20:36:32 +0300"},{"content":"Very clean budget hotel Just stayed at this property on a 3 night business trip for a super rate of $59 a night. Honolulu is just loaded with cheap hotel rooms but your mileage can vary A LOT! Last trip over I had stayed at the Park Shore, but I took a chance on the lower internet rate at the Ambassador, scared of what I might find! I was pleasantly surprised. The internet rate lands you a room on the lower three floors, and while I was a little concerned with street noise, the window coverings were very adequate, and noise was not an issue. As other reviews have stated, this is an older building, and there is nothing about it that is vacation-like. It is: A hotel. What was so nice was the cleanliness that was maintained along with a larger room; Perfect for a business trip like I was on. The staff was more than jovial and helpful. The parking was $9/day, reasonable for Waikiki. As always I suggest, if renting a car, get the smallest one available: Waikiki parking spots are tiny by mainland standards. The location of this property is close enough to the action if you want that, and yet near to the park at Fort Durussey (sp) and the elegance at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. One other nice little detail: if you wanted to go to the Hard Rock, it's easy walking distance. Same with the Convention Center. There are essentially no on-site amenities with the exception of the pool, small, but again, very nice and clean. As a business traveler I am extremely keen on clean and water pressure in the shower. Both of these expectations were met, and very nicely I might add. I'm sure this is why this older budget hotel receives three stars on the web and not 2 1/2 or less. By the way their little shampoo bottles? I loved their brand! If you need breakfast, you can walk around the corner to the (attached) Thai Restaurant which serves a budget breakfast with open air dining. If you need good Kona Coffee and pastry, there is a shop just outside the door, and if you forgot toiletries, there is an ABC store attached - of course there is one ABC store for every three tourists in Waikik. There is also a TGIF just accross the street at the Ohana Maile Sky Court. I can recomend this hotel for anyone who gets ill over paying $150 or more a night for a hotel while on vacation. It is a very well maintained property.  If this is a once in a lifetime vacation I would say two things: number one, skip Ohau and get yourself over to the other islands (Kauai is my favorite) and number two: if you are making Waikiki your destination and want a memorable Hotel experience, bite the bullet and pay for the Hilton Hawaiian Village or Halekulani experience. Remember: Honolulu is a very large metropolis with nearly a million people. Those other two properties I mention will isolate you from the big city feel and of Waikiki and all that goes along with it, quite nicely.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":-1.0,"Overall":4.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":4.0,"Location":-1.0},"author":"Ewald Lang","date":"2012-06-13 14:40:31 +0300"},{"content":"Worst place we ever stayed at Our hotel room at the Ambassador was shabby and run-down. The paint was peeling off the walls, the carpet was filthy, only a small bare light bulb over the sink in the bathroom. The TV did not work - all stations were nothing but snow. There was one station that one could see if you could see through the snow and the wavy white lines. We told the front office people twice about this and both times they promised that it would be fixed but it never was. Our wakeup call each morning was at 5 a.m. with the noise of delivery trucks, slamming of doors, and the annoying beep, beep, beep sound that trucks make when they back up. Just as we were about to go back to sleep, it would start all over again. We asked to be moved to an other room but they would not accomodate us. This was the worst place we have ever stayed at. We also had trouble with the parking key they gave us to get out of the parking lot - the one you insert that lifts the gate handle up. This happened three times that the gates would not open. We had to push the assistance buzzer. The third time it happened my husband pushed the assistance buzzer but no one would respond. I finally went inside the hotel where there were 4 people behind the desk but not one of them paid any attention to when we pushed the button for help.","ratings":{"Service":-1.0,"Business service":-1.0,"Cleanliness":-1.0,"Check in / front desk":-1.0,"Overall":1.0,"Value":-1.0,"Rooms":-1.0,"Location":-1.0},"author":"Juwan Krajcik","date":"2013-10-27 12:50:08 +0300"},{"content":"Great hotel  My husband and I were married in Hawaii and chose this hotel for its location  price (which actually seemed a little TOO cheap to us -- was $110 per night at the time). We were blown away at how lovely it was, what a prime location (directly across the street from the beach, and right nextdoor to the International Market). Hotel was very clean, service was very friendly and we had a balcony with a view of the city and partial of the beach. All in all, we couldn't have chosen better. Some of the other hotels in the area were fancier but a little on the snooty feel. This place just felt like Hawaii personified. They had Don $@!#% do a show at the hotel during our stay and the restaurant was lovely (outdoor setting). Food was excellent. There is also a shop for amenities within the hotel. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat!","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":4.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Marlee Dare","date":"2014-09-14 13:56:48 +0300"},{"content":"Good Hotel We stayed at the Waikiki Beachcomber from April 7 to 10. The rate was $169.00 per night. This was our third stay at this hotel. The hotel is in a prime location right across the street from the Pink Palace and just a short walk to the beach. We had an ocean view room looking at Diamond Head. One of the good things about staying here is the proximity to the market right next door. This time one of the bad things was the proximity to the market right next door. A new bar, Coconut Willey's, opend in the marketplace and the first night a band played until 1:30am. Very hard to sleep.In the morning my wife asked for another room and the hotel was most gracious in moving us to the other side of the hotel and the following nights were just fine.This hotel is very nice at letting you check out but come back and take a shower around dinner time if you are getting a plane late at night. Overall this is a good hotel for the price and I would recommend it.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Business service":4.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Check in / front desk":5.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":4.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Derick Skiles","date":"2012-03-10 03:36:45 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Elizabeth Christiansen","Dr. Eleazar Wyman","Bret Kassulke","Natasha Willms"],"vacancy":true,"description":"Just minutes from downtown Red Bluff and I-5, the Lamplighter Lodge, a Magnuson Hotels affiliate, is convenient to William B.
