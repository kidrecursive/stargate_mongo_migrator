I went to Hollywood from London,UK with another girl and Hotel staff were very helpful from the time we arrived at the hotel, they advised us about the vicinity, food, shopping taxi etc. The guys at reception always made conversation and did all the taxi bookings, printed us maps and told us the best places to shop (Thanks to the guy that gave us the heads up on the Armani shop on Sunset Strip and also Vctoria's Secret at the Farmer's market, so sorry I didn't get your name). The Area was very safe, everything you could ever need was at least 2mins away( bank, phamacy, supermarkets, hair salon etc). Very clean too. The courtyard was really clean, the swimming pool and jacuzzi are treated daily. It felt like home after a couple of days, thanks for your hospitality.","ratings":{"Service":5.0,"Cleanliness":5.0,"Overall":5.0,"Value":5.0,"Sleep Quality":5.0,"Rooms":5.0,"Location":5.0},"author":"Shaylee Ferry","date":"2015-09-01 14:39:34 +0300"},{"content":"Gay friendly, nice pool in garden, nice staff at reception, good location to Sunset and Hollywood Blvs, free parking, free wi-fi, the rooms are a little poor-equipped and old fashioned, but they're ok.","ratings":{"Cleanliness":2.0,"Sleep Quality":3.0,"Overall":3.0,"Value":3.0,"Service":4.0},"author":"Dion Schroeder","date":"2015-07-14 04:13:46 +0300"}],"public_likes":["Dr. Cloyd Kuhn","Sasha Terry","Judge Kessler","Ronny Kemmer"],"vacancy":true,"description":"A primitive campground located near the North Entrance Station.  18 sites, no water available.","alias":null,"pets_ok":true,"free_breakfast":true,"free_internet":true,"free_parking":false}
